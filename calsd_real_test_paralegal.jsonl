{"id": "real-5", "passage": "Polu Anil vs The State Of Telangana on 26 April, 2022. HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE K.SURENDER. CRIMINAL APPEAL No.43 OF 2020 JUDGMENT: 1. The appellant filed this appeal questioning the conviction recorded under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code and sentenced to undergo seven years simple imprisonment. However, the appellant was acquitted for the charges under Sections 354-A, 366-A of Indian Penal Code and Section 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO' Act). 2. Briefly stated, the case of the prosecution is that PW1 who is brother of the victim PW4 filed complaint Ex.P1 with the police stating that PW4 was missing and he suspected the appellant herein. According to prosecution case, the appellant took PW4 to a temple and tied gold 'pustela thadu' (sacred thread) around the neck of bride during marriage ceremony. Thereafter, PW4 and the appellant stayed at different places and nearly after ten days, the accused and PW4 were caught by the police. Thereafter, statement of PW4 was recorded by the Magistrate and the police. As per the statement given to the police and Magistrate under under section 164 CRPC marked as Ex.P4, PW4 stated that she was in love with the appellant and decided to marry him and went with the appellant on her own, taking one gold biscuit weighing six tulas. She told the appellant that they should elope and get married, accordingly, they went to Karimnagar in an auto and boarded a bus for Secunderabad and from Secunderabad they went to Thirupathi. Thereafter, they were caught by the police. On completion of investigation, the police filed charge sheet under Sections 366-A, 354 of Indian Penal Code and Section 12 of the POCSO Act, 2012. After the trial, the learned Sessions Judge found the appellant not guilty for the said charges, however, convicted the appellant under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code. 3. It is the specific case of PW4-victim that she was in love with the appellant and on her own she went with the appellant to Karimnagar and to Thirupathi where they got married and came back to Secunderabad. Neither in the statement made before the Court nor the statement made before the Magistrate under Ex.P4, did PW4 make any allegation of force against the appellant. Further, she stated during the chief-examination that accused did not make any sexual assault on her. 4. The learned Sessions Judge found that the girl was not a minor and the provisions of Section of POCSO Act did not attract. The trial Court also found that there was no allegation of any molestation for which reason, the trial Court found the appellant not guilty for the said offences. 5. Section 366 of Indian Penal Code reads as follows: \"366. Kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc.--Whoever kidnaps or abducts any woman with intent that she may be compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled, to marry any person against her will, or in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, or knowing it to be likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; 1 [and whoever, by means of criminal intimidation as defined in this Code or of abuse of authority or any other method of compulsion, induces any woman to go from any place with intent that she may be, or knowing that it is likely that she will be, forced or seduced to illicit intercourse with another person shall also be punishable as aforesaid].\" 6. Question of kidnapping or abducting does not arise when the evidence itself discloses that PW4 had taken six tulas of gold and asked the appellant to come along with him and on her own they went to Thirupathi and came back. There is not even a whisper for any kind of force or compulsion under which PW4 went along with the appellant for all the 15 days. 7. Having found that PW4 was not a child, having acquitted the appellant for the offences under POCSO Act and also having found that there was no outraging of modesty of victim girl, the trial Court ought to have acquitted the appellant. 8. As seen from the evidence none of the ingredients of Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code are made out and for the said reason, the appellant is liable to be acquitted of the charge under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code and accordingly, acquitted. The appeal is allowed setting aside the conviction of the appellant under Section 366 of IPC. Since the appellant is already on bail, the bail bonds shall stand cancelled.

Allahabad High Court Avinash Tripathi vs State Of U.P. & Anr. on 20 July, 2021 Author: Alok Mathur Bench: Alok Mathur HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD, LUCKNOW BENCH ?Court No. - 15 Case :- BAIL No. - 6901 of 2020 Applicant :- Avinash Tripathi Opposite Party :- State Of U.P. & Anr. Counsel for Applicant :- Prashant Singh Gaur,Anil Kumar Dwivedi,Sudhanshu Mishra,Umesh Kumar Yadav Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A. Hon'ble Alok Mathur,J. 1. Heard Sri Umesh Kumar Yadav, learned counsel for applicant as well as learned Additional Government Advocate. 2. Office has reported by means of report dated 01.03.2021 that respondent No. 2 has been served but no one has put in appearance on her behalf, the Court has proceeded to hear the bail application. 2. This application has been filed by the applicant who is an accused in connection with Case Crime No. 0108/2018, under Sections 376(D), 506 I.P.C. and 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station - Rajesultanpur, Ambedkar Nagar. 3. It has been submitted by learned counsel for applicant that the first information report was lodged by the prosecutrix herself who stated that she is 17 years of age and the occurrence relates to six months prior in time. One Prashant Mishra has been accused of dragging her into the field and sexually assaulted the prosecutrix. At the time of lodging of the first information report, it was stated that the prosecutrix was pregnant for six months and that the said accused therein, namely, Prashant Mishra has refused to marry her and consequently the first information report was lodged. The statement under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. was recorded after six months on 18.06.2018 where she has reiterated the contents of the first information report and named Prashant Kumar as to the person who has sexually assaulted the prosecutrix. The statement under Section 164 Cr. P.C. was recorded on 18.07.2018, it is stated that the applicant has been named as one of the person who has sexually assaulted the prosecutrix and consequently he was shown as an accused and chargesheet has been filed in the court of competent jurisdiction. 4. It has been submitted by learned counsel for applicant that the entire story as narrated by the prosecutrix is unbelievable and not worthy of any credence. He submits that the first information report was lodged by the prosecutrix herself and that too after six months of the incident and there is no explanation that as to why the applicant was not named as an accused or any other perosn who has sexually assaulted the prosecutrix in the F.I.R. itself. 5. It has further been submitted that the statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded after six months where again the name of the applicant has not been shown as an accused. He submits that it is in the statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. where the name of the applicant has come up and there is no reason that as to why the applicant was named in the statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. 6. It has further been submitted that D.N.A. test of the child was conducted for comparing to the same with the D.N.A. of the prosecutrix and to the said Prashant Mishra and the D.N.A. testing was confirmed that the father of the child is Prashant Mishra and not the applicant. 7. It has lastly been submitted that the applicant is in jail since 26.06.2020. 8. Learned A.G.A. opposed the prayer for bail and submits that the applicant has clearly named the applicant in the Statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C., therefore the applicant is not entitled for bail looking into the of his complicity in the case. 9. I have heard learned counsel for parties and perused the record. It is clear that there is no reason forth coming as to why the prosecutrix has not named the applicant either in the first information report or in the statement recorded after six months under Section 164 Cr.P.C. Coupled with the fact that the D.N.A. report has not confirmed the parentage of the child to that of the applicant herein and also considering the nature of allegations, arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties as well as the fact that applicant has in jail since 26.06.2020 where he has spent nearly one year in judicial custory, without expressing any opinion on the merit of the case, I find it to be a fit case for granting bail. 10. Let the applicant/Avinash Tripathi involved in Case Crime No. 0108/2018, under Sections 376(D), 506 I.P.C. and 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station - Rajesultanpur, Ambedkar Nagar be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned with the following conditions which are being imposed in the interest of justice:- (i) The applicant shall file an undertaking to the effect that he shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in court. In case of default of this condition, it shall be open for the trial court to treat it as abuse of liberty of bail and pass orders in accordance with law. (ii) The applicant shall remain present before the trial court on each date fixed, either personally or through his counsel. In case of his absence, without sufficient cause, the trial court may proceed against him under Section 229-A of the Indian Penal Code. (iii) In case, the applicant misuses the liberty of bail during trial and in order to secure his presence, proclamation under Section 82 Cr.P.C. is issued and the applicant fails to appear before the court on the date fixed in such proclamation, then, the trial court shall initiate proceedings against him, in accordance with law, under Section 174-A of the Indian Penal Code. (iv) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on the dates fixed for (i) opening of the case, (ii) framing of charge and (iii) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. If in the opinion of the trial court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law. 11. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, the Court below shall be at liberty to cancel the bail and proceed against the applicant in accordance with law. 12. The application stands disposed of. 13. The party shall file computer generated copy of order downloaded from the official website of High Court Allahabad, self attested by him alongwith a self attested identity proof of the said person(s) (preferably Aadhar Card) mentioning the mobile number(s) to which the said Aadhar Card is linked before the concerned Court/Authority/Official. 14.

Admitted facts are as follows; The first petitioner had married the defacto complainant on 27/4/2009. Thereafter, they resided together for some time. The second petitioner is his father and the third petitioner is his mother. A girl child was born, who is aged 7 years now. Matrimonial dispute arose between the parties. It is stated that, on 5/9/2017, the wife left the matrimonial home. The child was in the custody of the petitioners till 15/9/2017, on which day the child was entrusted with the parents of the defacto complainant. The present complaint was laid by the wife alleging that the first petitioner had sexually abused the seven year old girl on few days between 5/9/2017 to 15/9/2017 at the matrimonial home and other places. Apprehending arrest, the petitioners herein have approached this court. The specific contention of the petitioners herein is that, the defacto complainant was a quarrelsome person and matrimonial relationship became incompatible. It was alleged that, the defacto complainant had developed a close intimacy with one doctor who was younger to her. She was found making secret audio and video calls to him over the mobile phone. When the relationship went beyond a limit, the husband intervened and she was warned. It was later understood that she continued to maintain even physical relationship with him. On being confronted with materials, she is stated to have abandoned the child and left the matrimonial home on 5/9/2017. Thereafter, the first petitioner herein entrusted the child to the defacto complainant and her parents, considering the education of the child. The first petitioner herein initiated matrimonial proceedings, including an application for custody of the child. The present complaint was filed belatedly raising absolutely false allegations with the intention of denying him the custody of the child. It was vehemently contended that, the first petitioner herein has not committed any sexual abuse on the minor girl and it was purposefully and belatedly set up. Annexure A1 is a copy of the petition in O.P.(HMA) No. 649/2017 dated 27/10/2017 filed by the first petitioner herein before the Family Court, Malappuram. He claimed divorce on the ground of adultery of the defacto complainant with the doctor, who was arrayed as the second respondent in that O.P. It was alleged therein that, she was having continuous physical relationship with that doctor and was caught with evidence. Annexure A2 is a copy of O.P.( G & W) No. 356/2018 filed by the first petitioner herein on 24/5/2018 before the Family Court, Malappuram claiming custody of the child. Thereafter, Crime was got registered by the wife at Bangalore as Crime No. 703/2017 on 11/12/2017 against the petitioners herein alleging matrimonial cruelty. The first petitioner sought bail which was granted by Annexure A3 order. It is seen that, she alleged that the petitioners herein committed acts of matrimonial cruelty and demanded dowry and thereby committed offences punishable under section 498A IPC and the provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The petitioner was granted anticipatory bail. Annexure A5 is a complaint filed by the defacto complainant before the State Commission for Protection of Child Child Rights of Kerala and Karnataka, with copies to the various authorities. It was alleged that, the father-in-law of the defacto complainant had made sexual advances towards her. She alleged that, in-laws had administered various medicines on her body. It was also alleged that, the child was physically assaulted by the petitioners during the period from 5/9/2017 to 15/9/2017. There is an allegation that, the grandfather used to beat her on her groin and grandmother had beaten the child with a chapathy rolling pin. Annexure A6 is the complaint No.20/2018 filed on 24/1/2018 by the defacto complainant under the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. The above documents clearly show that, at no point of time earlier, the defacto complainant had a case that the child was sexually abused by the father. Even though physical assault is alleged against the petitioners, there was absolutely no reference anywhere that the child was subjected to sexual abuse by the father. It seems that, for the first time such a complaint is seen raised in the present crime(Crime No.548/2018 of Ottappalam Police station). Crime was thereupon registered for offences punishable under sections 7 & 8 of POCSO Act and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act 2015. The crux of the allegation in the FIS is that, during the period when the child was in the custody of the petitioners, the father of the child used to give her a bath. He used to undress her, remove his dress and give her bath. It was stated that in the course of bathing her, the first petitioner used to tickle her. The child has stated that, she did not like boys giving her bath. Pursuant to it, section 164 Cr.P.C.statement of the victim was also recorded, which is substantially in tune with FI statement. It is pertinent to note that the only allegation raised against the first petitioner is as above. Even if the entire statement made by the child is taken at its face value, crucial question that arises is whether the father had any sexual intent while giving the daughter a bath. This has to be appreciated in the background that the allegation comes only at a highly belated stage, when the father himself had sought custody of the child. No explanation is forthcoming for the delay in giving complaint. Hence, the question to be investigated by the police is only whether the first petitioner herein with sexual intention had committed any act. For that, custodial interrogation does not appear to be warranted. It is also clear that, in such a very strained matrimonial relationship a belated allegation of this nature has to be considered carefully and it may not be safe to order custodial interrogation. Having regard to the above, I am inclined to grant benefit of anticipatory bail to the petitioners herein subject to the following conditions: i). Petitioners shall appear before the investigating officer within ten days from today and shall undergo interrogation. Thereafter, if they are proposed to be arrested, they shall be released on bail on each of the petitioner executing a bond for a sum of Rs.50,000/-(Rupees fifty thousand only) with two sureties for the like sum each. ii). They shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when called for and co-operate with the investigation. Anticipatory Bail Application is allowed.", "question_canonical": "In light of the legal provisions under the POCSO Act and the findings in the passage, what steps need to be taken to protect the interests and rights of the minor child involved, while considering the allegations presented regarding the father and other family members?", "options": {"A": "The child should be immediately returned to the father as there are no substantial allegations against him.", "B": "An investigation must be conducted to clarify the intentions behind the allegations made by the defacto complainant before deciding on custody.", "C": "Custody should be granted to the maternal grandparents without any inquiry into the facts of the case.", "D": "The child should be placed in a foster care system without investigating the allegations made by the wife."}, "correct_answer_text": "An investigation must be conducted to clarify the intentions behind the allegations made by the defacto complainant before deciding on custody.", "rationale_statutory": "The passage states that the allegations were made belatedly and there lacks substantial evidence for sexual abuse.

Today, when the matter was taken up for hearing a joint Memo of Compromise was filed before this Court signed by the petitioners and the second respondent and their respective counsels. The petitioners and the second respondent/defacto complainant and the victim girl present before this Court, identified by Mr.P.Chellapandian, SSI, Jeyamangalam Police Station, Theni District, as well as by the learned Counsel appearing for the parties.

Mundka, Delhi. The present FIR came to be registered on a complaint given by the elder brother of the child victim, wherein it was stated that the child victim, who was aged about 12 years and 02 months, had gone missing and it was suspected that their neighbor had enticed her away. Subsequently, on 30.03.2021, the child victim was produced before the concerned Police Station by her brother and her medical examination was conducted at Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Mangol Puri, Delhi. At the hospital, the child victim underwent the Urine Pregnancy Test (hereinafter, referred to as the ‘UPT’) and the test came out to be positive. The statement of the child victim was recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C., wherein she stated that the accused, a neighbour, had forcibly established sexual relations with her and taken her to Bihar without her consent.

PW6 requested the Magistrate to record the statement of the prosecutrix under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. He also referred the accused for medical examination and recorded the statement of the other witnesses and filed the charge sheet upon completion of investigation. The Accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and claimed to be tried. Prosecution in support of its case examined 6 witnesses. Statement of the accused was recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. The defence of the accused was that of total denial. He has stated that the prosecutrix always used to run away from home. He objected to the same as he did not approve of the same. He claims that sometimes he used to beat her and hence she has lodged false complaint against him. The Accused has examined his wife as DW1. After evaluating the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the learned Judge has held that the evidence of the prosecutrix amply proves that the Accused herein had subjected her to rape. Hence, relying upon the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, the learned Judge held the Accused guilty of offence under section 376(ii)(f) of the IPC and section 5(n) of POCSO Act, 2012 and sentenced him as stated above. Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence, the accused has preferred this Appeal under Section 374 of Cr.P.C. The evidence of PW2 reveals that she was housed in Bal Sudhar Griha for theft of a laptop. About a month later, the accused brought her home. She has deposed that the accused did not allow her to leave the house and used to beat her. She therefore ran away from the house, but the accused brought her back and assaulted her and cut her hair. The evidence of this witness is not reliable and trustworthy. She has not emerged as a truthful witness and has not passed the test of a 'sterling witness' and hence no conviction can be based on the uncorroborated testimony of PW2. The trial Court has based the conviction on conjectures and surmises, which are not well founded. Hence the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. Under the circumstances, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. The accused is acquitted of offences under Section 376(2)(f) and 506 of Indian Penal Code and under Section 5 (n) r/w. Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).

On the basis of the statement of the victim girl recorded under section 164 of Cr.P.C, section 506/509 IPC and Section 12 of POCSO Act were added and challan was prepared under sections 354/506/509/34 of IPC and section 8 & 12 of POCSO Act and put up before the court on 11.12.2015 for trial against the accused Fareem Beg. 4. On 29.02.2016, after hearing the Ld. Defence Counsel for the accused Fareem Beg and the Ld. Special Public Prosecution, Charge for the offences punishable under sections 354 of IPC and. 5. The victim and the complainant, who is also father of the victim on whose complaint the present FIR got registered against the accused Fareem Beg, are the star and material witnesses of the prosecution, who could have proved the allegations levelled against the accused. But the prosecution has miserably failed to examine both the witnesses despite availing sufficient opportunities. The prosecution even could not trace out the victim and her father and they could not be served despite best efforts made by the prosecution. The victim girl though in her statement recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C. stated that she was playing at 6'O clock in the evening and at that time Naim, Fareem (accused in the present case) and Shejzaad came there. Naim caught her, Fareem caught and kissed her and put his both the hands in her panty and tried to open her pajama. She shouted loudly then her father came and they all fled away. She further sated that Fareem and Naim came to her father later and threatened him if he would make any complaint in this regard, they would kill her father. But the victim girl did not appear in the witness box to prove all these allegations. In the absence of testimony of victim and her father, no incriminating evidence has come on record against the accused. There is no other eyewitness to the incident. Rest of the witnesses are formal i.e. the counselor who counseled the victim, the principal to prove the age of the victim, DO to prove the registration of FIR, IO and the Ld. MM who recorded the statement of victim u/s 164 Cr.P.C. Hence, it will be a futile exercise to examine rest of the witnesses in this case, as none of them is an eyewitness to the incident. Continuing with this trial any further, will only result in wastage of time and resources, and there will be no impact on the result of this trial. Hence, the prosecution evidence is closed and the SA of the accused is dispensed with. 6. In the overall facts and circumstances of the case, there being no material or incriminating evidence against the accused Fareem Beg, he cannot be said to be guilty of committing the offences as charged against him and he is entitled to be acquitted. Accordingly, Accused Fareem Beg is acquitted of the offences punishable under sections 354 of IPC and section 10 of POCSO Act. 7. However, Fareem Beg is required to furnish bail bond under section 437A of Cr.P.C, which shall remain in force for a period of six months. 8. File be consigned to Record Room, after due compliance of provisions of section 437A of Cr.P.C. by Fareem Beg. Pronounced in the open Court (Balwant Rai Bansal) on 30th of May, 2017.

The petitioner along with four other persons had sexually abused and committed oral sex. Love-co-accused has also sexually abused the child in the room of Rinku. The petitioner had taken the child to Sergarh where he was kept in custody.

The statement of the victim as well as his parents have also been recorded.

In brief the case of the prosecution as per Ex.P.2 is as under:- That victim girl has given a letter to the coordinator, BOSCO Child Line, Bangalore on 03.11.2014 alleging that accused misbehaving with her by touching her private parts since she was of 7 years old, since one year back, she was sexually abused by the accused by showing the obscene video telling that he will purchase new dresses for her and also threatened her not to disclose the incident to anyone. Based on the said letter, the complainant has lodged the complaint as per Ex.P7 and case has been registered by the Investigation Officer and charge sheet has been filed against the accused. 3. As soon as charge sheet was filed and the prosecution papers were made available to the accused as required under section 207 of Criminal Procedure Code, the learned counsel appearing for the accused and the learned Public Prosecutor were heard regarding the framing of charge under section 354 and 376 Indian Penal Code and 5(L)(M) R/w. 6 of POCSO Act 2012. Charge was framed and read over and explained to the accused. Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Therefore the case was posted for evidence of the prosecution. 4.

Heard Learned Public Prosecutor for the state, and learned counsel appearing for the accused. 6. Now the point that arise for my consideration are: 1) Whether prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt: (a) That accused since from 2 years attempted to outrage the modesty of the victim girl by showing obscene videos and thereby committed the offence Punishable U/sec.354 of Indian Penal Code? (b) That since from one year accused committed rape against the victim girl against her will and thereby committed the offence Punishable U/sec. 376 of Indian Penal Code? (c) That accused had sexually assaulted the victim girl aged below 12 years and thereby committed the offence Punishable U/sec. 5(L) R/w.6 POCSO Act 2012? (d) That accused committed sexual assault against the victim girl more than once and thereby committed the offence Punishable U/ sec. 5(M) R/w.6 of POCSO Act? 2) What Order? 7. My findings above points are as under:- Point No.1 (a) : In the negative Point No.1 (b) : In the negative Point No.1 (c) : In the negative Point No.1 (d) : In the negative Point No.2 : as per final Order REASONS 8. Point No.1(a) to (d):- All the points are taken up together as they are inter related to each other. 9. The burden is on the prosecution to prove that accused since from one year back accused committed sexual assault against the victim girl Cw2 against her will and since from 2 years accused used to touch her body and used to show obscene videos and misbehaved with her. 10. Now let me consider the other oral evidence adduced by the prosecution. 11. Pw1 victim girl deposed in her evidence that she has not given statement before the police alleging that accused misbehaved with her and committed sexual assault and she is not aware of the contents written in Ex.P1 and Ex.P2, wherein she put her signature. She also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and she denied that she has lodged complaint as per Ex.p2 alleging that accused misbehaved with her and committed sexual assault and raped her and police drew mahazer as per Ex.P1. She also denied that she has given statement before the police as per Ex.P3 stating that accused misbehaved with her and committed rape showing obscene videos. She also stated that Ex.P2 is not in her hand writing and she only signed Ex.P2. 12. Pw2 Bhavani Devi mother of the victim girl deposed that she has not given statement before the police regarding the alleged incident. The said witness is also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and she has given statement before the police as per Ex.P4 stating that she came to know the accused misbehaved with the victim girl and sexually harassed her. 13. Pw3 Balaram deposed in his evidence that victim girl is his sister's daughter. He has not given statement before the police that accused misbehaved with the victim girl. The said witness is also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and he denied that he has given statement before the police that he came to know that accused misbehaved with the Pw2 and sexually harassed her. 14. Pw4 Ravi Kumar who is a mahazer witness deposed in his evidence that he put his signature to mahazer Ex.P1 about one year back in Subramanyapura police station and not known the contents. He also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and he denied that police drew the mahazer on 07.11.2014 at House No.27, 1st floor, Byraveswara Nilaya, ABM colony, Bangalore and after knowing the contents of the mahazer, he has signed and deposing falsely. 15. Pw5 Annappa who is also mahazer witness deposed in his evidence that he put his signature to mahazer Ex.P6 in the police station and not known the contents. He also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and he denied that police drew the mahazer on 07.11.2014 at House No.15,2nd floor, Old Bank Colony, Rushyashrunga Road, Bangalore and seized the mobile. 16. Pw6 Manjuanth complainant deposed in his evidence that on 01.11.2014 at 5-00 p.m., received the phone message from the public, it was attended by Idayith attender and on the same day at 6-00 p.m., Idayith told that he received from phone message from the public with respect of sexual assault. On the next day, he went to the shop of the accused along with Akshitha and introduced as BEO Office officials came to enquire about the victim, as she has not attended the classes. Accused called his wife to bring the victim girl. Victim girl and her mother came at 12-20 p.m., take away the victim girl in the Jeep and she disclosed the sexual assault by the accused since two years and also gave it in writing and reported the matter to the Director and Coordinator. Thereafter, lodged the complaint as per Ex.P7. 17. On perusal of the evidence of Pw1, Pw1 and Akshitha representing themselves that they are from BEO office had come to enquire about the victim girl, as why she has not attending the school regularly. Accused asked to bring the victim girl and victim girl was brought by her mother at 12-20 p.m., and on enquiry the victim girl narrated the incident and also in writing as per Ex.P2. 18. It is clear from the records that case has been registered based on the complaint lodged by the complainant. It is the case of the complainant that he was not in the office while Idayith attender received the phone call. Idayith attender of Child Line is not examined by the prosecution. Pw6 also admits that they have maintained the registers for having received the phone calls from the public. It is clear from the evidence of Pw1 that immediately after he came to know about the incident, he has not reported the incident to the Special Juvenile Unit or the Local police U/Sec.19(1)(a)(b) of POCSO Act 2012. Pw6 admits that he has not furnished the copy of the register maintained by them regarding phone call received in their office to the jurisdictional police. On perusal of the prosecution papers, Investigation Officer has not enquired Idayith attender of the Child Line who received the phone call from the public. On perusal of the evidence of Pw6, he lodged the complaint as per Ex.P7, after discussion with his superior officers and immediately he has not brought to the notice of the jurisdictional police with respect of the alleged incident. 19. The prosecution case is not supported by the evidence of Pw1 victim girl and she denied the incident in toto. She denied the sexual harassment by the accused and denied the contents of Ex.P1 and Ex.P2 is known to her. She denied that she has given complaint to the Child Line as per Ex.P2 and police drew mahazer on 07.11.2015. She also stated that Ex.P2 is not in her hand writing and she only signed and she does not know to read and write English and Kannada. The prosecution case is also not supported by the evidence of Pw2 Bhavani Devi mother of the victim girl and Pw3 Balaram relative of the complainant. They have denied the incident and also denied that they have stated before the police as per Ex.P3 to Ex.P5. 20. Ex.P1 mahazer dated 07.11.2014 alleged to have been drawn in the house of the victim girl is not supported by the victim girl and Pw4 Ravi Kumar deposed that he has signed the mahazer in the police station. Ex.P6 mahazer dated 07.11.2014 is also not proved by the prosecution. Pw5 Annappa who is a mahazer witness deposed in his evidence that he has not known the contents of Ex.P6 and he put his signature about 6 months back at Subramanyapura police station and not known its contents. Hence, Ex.P7 mahazer is also not proved by the prosecution satisfactorily. 21. In an offence under section 376 of Indian Penal Code the evidence of the prosecution plays a vital role. The evidence of the victim girl can be accepted without there being corroboration. However, if there are any inconsistency or discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, then the court has to look for corroboration to the evidence of the victim girl, but the prosecution case is not supported by the evidence of the victim girl herself. 22. The prosecution case is also not supported by the evidence of Pws. 1 to 3 and mahazer witness Pw4 and Pw5. The Investigation Officer is also not examined. The mobile phone which accused used to show obscene videos to the victim girl is also not seized by the Investigation Officer. 23. Thus the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt on the part of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. Hence, in view of all these reasons, I answer point No.1(a) to 1(d) in the negative. 24. Point No.2:- In view of the aforesaid reasons and findings on point Nos.1(a) to (d), accused is found not guilty for the above said offences, in the result, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER Acting under section 235(1) of Criminal Procedure Code, accused is acquitted for the offences punishable Under Section 354 and 376 of Indian Penal Code and section 5(L)(M) R/w.6 of POCSO Act 2012. Bail bonds and surety bonds shall stands cancelled. (Dictated to the Judgment writer, corrected and then pronounced in Open Court on this the 25th day of NOVEMBER, 2015.)

CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 29.12.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No.5644 OF 2020(E)\nORDER\nDated this the 29th day of December 2020\nThe petitioner is the accused in SC.No.698/2019 before the Additional District and Sessions (POCSO) Court, Ernakulam. The accused is alleged to have committed offences under Section 376(2) of Indian Penal Code read with Section 6 and 5J(ii) of the POCSO Act, 2012. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that petitioner and the 2nd respondent - the victim, were in love with each other and in their relationship, a child was even born. Photograph of the child along with the petitioner and the 2nd respondent is produced as Ann: A6. It is also pleaded that the crime No.342/2019 was registered on the basis of some misunderstanding and that, subsequent to the birth of the child, petitioner as well as the 2nd respondent have married each other. True copy of the marriage certificate issued by the marriage officer, Njarackal is produced as Ann: A4 and the birth certificate of the child is produced as Ann: A5. The prosecution alleges that on 26.1.2019, at 11.00 a.m, the petitioner committed rape on the victim and the victim became pregnant. The crime was registered on the basis of a complaint by the victim. According to the petitioner, the victim and the petitioner were involved in a romantic relationship and have even married. The complaint was filed on a total misunderstanding and no proper investigation was also carried out. It is contended that continuance of the proceedings is a sheer abuse of the process of Court and no purpose will be served other than waste of judicial time. Petitioner is only aged 25 years and taking into consideration the gravity of the offences alleged as well as the subsequent developments, especially the marriage between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent and the settlement arrived at there is no purpose in continuing the case. The settlement is reflected through Ann: A3 affidavit, wherein the victim as well as her parents have sworn to an affidavit, stating that they have no complaints or allegations against the petitioner and they have come into to good terms with each other and also that no purpose would be served in continuing the criminal proceedings. The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, submits that the Police have taken the statement of the victim and have verified the veracity of the affidavit produced before this Court as Ann: A3. According to the learned prosecutor, the affidavit is genuine and can be acted upon. In view of the above circumstances, continuance of the proceedings in SC No.698/2019 before the Sessions Court, Ernakulam will only be an abuse of the process of Court. Since the matter has been settled by the parties and the petitioner has admittedly married the alleged victim, no evidence will be forthcoming to support the prosecution case. Continuance of the prosecution is therefore an abuse of process of Court and serves no purpose. In the result, the Crl.MC is allowed.

The victim in the instant case is a minor girl aged 13 years. Her mother is no more and her father has remarried and is living elsewhere. She is now admitted in the Don Bosco Snehabhavan at Ernakulam. It appears that when she appeared moody and showed behavioral problems, a Counselor interacted with her. The disclosure she made is heart rending. The Counselor informed the child line authorities who in turn intimated the police. It is in the above fact scenario that the crime was registered. 4.According to the victim child, who is now studying in the 8th standard, the petitioner is a near relative and she calls him 'valiachan'. According to her, when she was in the 2nd standard, the petitioner started sexually assaulting her. He used to touch her private parts and used to perform oral sex on her. She was made to touch his genitals as well. On various occasions thereafter, the petitioner repeated the same acts. As she had no one to disclose the sexual abuse that she was being subjected to and as she was confused, she did not reveal this fact to anyone. In the month of September, 2017, the petitioner repeated the same acts. This tormented her and she became moody and restless which fact was noticed by the Counselor. Pursuant to the registration of the crime, the petitioner was arrested on 28.10.2017 and has been in custody since then. 5.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is a 52 year old man and is undergoing treatment for cardiac ailments at the Kottayam Medical College Hospital for the past six months. It is submitted that there are serious inconsistencies in the statement given by the victim child. There was no way that the petitioner could have sexually assaulted the minor child is the submission. 6.The learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer and has made available the case diary for perusal. 7.I have gone through the same and It tells a very sad story. The victim child is a destitute with no one to look after and has been housed in various institutions since a very young age. The petitioner, by abusing his status as a near relative, has sexually assaulted the child. The investigation is still in the early stages and I find no reason to release the petitioner on bail.

SC No.3 of 2014, dated 06.07.2015. The case of the prosecution is that prior three months to 30.08.2013, all the accused on different occasions had individually called the victim Mariselvi to their houses made her lie down on the floor undressed her full skirt and inserted the penis into her vagina and committed penetrative sexual assault and further more, A1 enticed the child by showing obscene pictures through CD and forced her to act of such. The Inspector of Police attached to All Women Police Station has filed a final report against the accused persons examining the witnesses.  \n The trial court after careful perusal of the entire materials available on record, A1 to A3 found guilty under section 5(l) r/w 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and each are convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/-, in default each to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1 month. Aggrieved over the same, A1 to A3 are before this court as appellants by filing these criminal appeals.  \n In this case, PW2 is the victim, and PW1 is the mother of the victim. In respect of the place of occurrence, Exs.P14 and Ex.P16 (Rough Sketches) were marked. On perusal of Exs.P14 and Ex.P16, it reveals that the place of occurrence is shown as the house of A1 to A3. PW2 during her chief examination stated that A2 took her to his cement shop and subjected her to sexual intercourse. Further, the evidence of PW2 is corroborated with the evidence of PW1, PW5 and PW10/Doctor. The victim deposed about the sexual intercourse by all the accused and the rupture of hymen proved that the victim was subject to sexual assault.

{"id": "real-225", "passage": "Jibitha vs Diyol on 28 January, 2020. The petitioner is the respondent in I.A.No.1162/2019 in GOP No.467/2019, on the file of Family Court, Trissur. The respondent in this original petition had filed the above application seeking interim custody of his minor son Dhanvin and permission to interact with his younger son Sidharth during holidays and vacation periods. In the application filed before the Family Court, the respondent had, inter alia, pleaded that, after the birth of the younger child, the petitioner refused to return to the matrimonial home. Subsequently, there was a mediation, and a rapprochement was effected. Immediately after conceiving the younger child, the petitioner went to her parental home and thereafter, has refused to resume co-habitation. The respondent is anxious to look after the welfare of the children, but the petitioner is not permitting the same. Therefore, interim custody of the older child may be given to him, and he be permitted to interact with the younger child. The application was opposed by the petitioner, who filed a written objection, inter alia, contending that the respondent is an alcoholic. Subsequent to the separation between them, there was a settlement before the Police, and the older child was agreed to be given on every Friday. However, the respondent's close friend Jayesh abused the child, and on a complaint by the petitioner, Crime No.93/2019 was registered by the Guruvayoor Police Station, for offences punishable under POCSO Act and under Section 377 of IPC against Jayesh. Hence custody of the child shall not be given to the petitioner. The petitioner hence prays that the application may be dismissed. The Family Court after considering the application and the counter filed, and also after interacting with the child, who did not raise any complaint against the father, held that by merely raising allegations of sexual assault against the respondent's friend, the respondent cannot be restricted from having interim custody and visitation rights of his children. Accordingly, the Family Court allowed I.A.No.1162/2019 by granting interim custody of the older child to the respondent from 11 a.m. of every 2nd Saturday till 3 p.m. on the following Sunday, with visitation right from 11 am to 1 pm on every 4th Sunday. Likewise, the respondent was permitted to interact with the younger child from 10 am to 11 am on every 2nd Saturday and from 11 am to 1 pm on every 4th Sunday. It is challenging the above order this original petition is filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, contending that the impugned order passed by the Family Court is erroneous and improper and is liable to be set aside. This Court in Suhara and Others v. Muhammed Jaleel [2019 (2) KLT 960] has held that, even if one of the parents is accused of an allegation in a crime under the POCSO Act, is no assurance to a Family court that the allegation is true. The Court has to consider the paramount welfare and interest of the child while granting custody of the child to such parent, and further that the registration of the crime is not a bar in granting the parent access and visitation right of the child. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Anjali Kapoor vs. Rajiv Baijal [(2009) 7 SCC 322] has categorically declared the law that in a battle for custody of the child, Court should see what would best serve the welfare and interest of the child, which is the soul and predominant criteria and not the legal rights of the warring parents. In a most recent decision by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Yashita Sahu vs State of Rajasthan and others [2020 SCC OnLine (SC) 50] rendered on 20.1.2020, has declared as follows: 'The child is the victim in custody battles. In this fight of egos and increasing acrimonious battles and litigations between two spouses, our experience shows that more often than not, the parents who otherwise love their child, present a picture as if the other spouse is a villain and he or she alone is entitled to the custody of the child. The court must therefore be very vary of what is said by each of the spouses. A child, especially a child of tender years requires the love, affection, company, protection of both parents. This is not only the requirement of the child but is his/her basic human right. Just because the parents are at war with each other, does not mean that the child should be denied the care, affection, love or protection of any one of the two parents. A child is not an inanimate object which can be tossed from one parent to the other. Every separation, every re-union may have a traumatic and psychosomatic impact on the child. Therefore, it is to be ensured that the court weighs each and every circumstance very carefully before deciding how and in what manner the custody of the child should be shared between both the parents. Even if the custody is given to one parent the other parent must have sufficient visitation rights to ensure that the child keeps in touch with the other parent and does not lose social, physical and psychological contact with any one of the two parents. It is only in extreme circumstances that one parent should be denied contact with the child. Reasons must be assigned if one parent is to be denied any visitation rights or contact with the child. Courts dealing with the custody matters must while deciding issues of custody clearly define the nature, manner and specifics of the visitation rights.' Undisputedly, in the present case the allegation is that, the respondent's friend and neighbour attempted to abuse the child and he is accused in POCSO case, therefore, the child shall not be given to the respondent. In view of the categoric declaration of law in the authoritative precedents cited supra, we are unable to accept the contentions that the handing over of the custody of the older child to the respondent would be detrimental to the paramount welfare and best interest of the older child, and that the respondent should be denied visitation rights of the younger child. The learned Judge of the Family Court had interacted with the older child and found that he has no complaint to go with his father and that there is no harm if the older child is being sent with the father on every 2nd Saturday till the following Sunday. Similarly, the father has been given visitation right to see the younger child also on every 2nd Saturday and 4th Sunday. The granting of interim custody and visitation rights would only benefit their paramount welfare and best interest. It is the welfare of the children that is to be looked into and not the rights and defences of the quarrelling parents. We do not find any ground warranting interference with the impugned order invoking the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The original petition is without merit. Accordingly, the Original Petition is dismissed.", "question_canonical": "In light of the situation involving Jibitha and Diyol regarding custody and visitation rights, what procedural steps can the petitioner follow to further contest the ruling of the Family Court, and how might these steps relate to ensuring the safety and welfare of the children involved?", "options": {"A": "The petitioner can file for a restraining order against the respondent without further evidence.", "B": "The petitioner can initiate an appeal process based on alleged threats and file for an evaluation of the children's circumstances.", "C": "The petitioner must accept the ruling as it is without further legal recourse available.", "D": "The petitioner can handle the situation informally by discussing it with the respondent."}, "correct_answer_text": "The petitioner can initiate an appeal process based on alleged threats and file for an evaluation of the children's circumstances.", "rationale_statutory": "The passage indicates that the petitioner has filed an original petition challenging the Family Court's decision, suggesting a legal path to appeal based on concerns for the children's welfare, thus providing the opportunity to ensure their safety.", "question_user": "In light of the situation involving Jibitha and Diyol regarding custody and visitation rights, what procedural steps can the petitioner follow to further contest the ruling of the Family Court, and how might these steps relate to ensuring the safety and welfare of the children involved?", "noise": {"misspellings": 0, "colloquialisms": 0, "sms_slang": 0, "indianism": 0, "extraneous": false, "ambiguity": false, "num_fuzz": false, "ops_noise": 0, "case_rand": false, "drop_articles": false}, "robustness_tags": ["long_context"]}

Ashok Chauhan R/o: House No.363, Firoz Gandhi Colony, Basai Road, Gurugram, Haryana. ............ Accused. Date of Institution : 23.09.2017. Date of Reserving Judgment : Unreserved. Date of Pronouncement : 04.05.2018. Accused Rohit @ Sonu S/o Sh. Ashok Chauhan has been facing trial for the commission of the offences punishable under section 6 r/w 5 of the POCSO Act 2012 and section 376 (2) of the IPC, on the allegations that, he committed rape and aggravated penetrative sexual assault upon the girl child (the victim/prosecutrix), namely, 'N' (PW1, whose real name withheld in order to conceal her identity), aged 16 years. The brief facts of the case are that on 23.06.2017, the prosecutrix came to the PS­ Mehrauli and made a complaint to the police that she was sexually abused by a boy, namely, Rohit @ Sonu by promising to marry her. She also alleged that she also got pregnant and when she disclosed this fact to Rohit, he suggested her to terminate the pregnancy and on his persistent advice, she ate hot things due to which, her pregnancy was terminated. She alleged that on 19.06.2017, Rohit made physical relations with her lastly and on 20.06.2017, despite her repeated insistence, he refused to marry with her. Making the said complaint, the prosecutrix prayed for legal action against accused Rohit. Thereafter, the site plan of the place of occurrence was prepared at the instance of the prosecutrix and accused Rohit was arrested. The prosecutrix and the accused were medically examined. The statement of the prosecutrix was also recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. During the course of the investigation, the age proof of the prosecutrix was also collected. After completion of the investigation, the charge­sheet was prepared and filed in the court concerned for the commission of the offences punishable under sections 313/376 of the IPC and section 6 of the POCSO Act 2012. Charge for the commission of the offences punishable under section 6 of the POCSO Act and section 376 (2) of the IPC was framed against the accused Rohit @ Sonu, to which, the accused pleaded not­guilty and claimed trial, and the case was proceeded for prosecution evidence. In the list of witnesses, the prosecution cited 16 witnesses, out of which, two witnesses, including the prosecutrix as PW1 and her mother as PW2, have been examined so far. It is submitted by Ld. Counsel for the accused that the prosecutrix who is the main witness of the prosecution has already been examined as PW1 alongwith her mother as PW2, who is the hearsay witness, and no other public witness remained to be examined. He submitted that PW1, who is the main and crucial witness, has not supported the case of the prosecution. The Ld. Counsel has submitted that since nothing incriminating evidence has come against the accused, therefore, to save the precious time and manpower and resources of the court, the further proceedings in the present case may be stopped, and the accused may be acquitted of the offences charged against him. On the other hand, the Ld. Special Public Prosecutor has opposed the contentions made by the counsel for the accused. I have considered the submissions made on behalf of both the parties and have gone through the record of the case. There are 16 witnesses cited by the prosecution in the list of witnesses, to prove its case. Out of the said 16 prosecution witnesses, two witnesses have already been examined, including the prosecutrix as PW1. It is pertinent to evaluate herein the testimony of PW1, who is the main and important witness of the prosecution, to decide the fate of the case. PW1, the prosecutrix 'N' (full particulars are mentioned at Sl. No.01 in the list of the witnesses and the name withheld in order to conceal her identity) deposed that on 19.06.2017, it was the birthday of Rohit and they had celebrated his birthday in her house and thereafter, they went for shopping. In the evening, after shopping, Rohit dropped her to her house. She was asking him to marry her but he was not giving the clear answer and therefore, a quarrel took place between them. On the next day, he did not pick up her phone and she went to the police station and told the police that she was having friendship with Rohit for the last 4 ­ 5 years and he is not picking her phone. She stated that police obtained her signatures on some blank papers. She deposed that Rohit did not do any wrongful act with her and they were only friends. She deposed that she has married with Rohit on 23.08.2017. PW1 (the prosecutrix) was cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor and during her cross­examination, she denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor. PW2, namely, 'S' (full particulars withheld in order to conceal the identity) is the mother of the prosecutrix, who also turned hostile. In her evidence, she stated that her victim daughter was having friendly relations with Rohit being the neighbour, and she did not tell about their relationship or that Rohit has committed any wrongful act with her. PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix) was also cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor, in which, she also denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor. As already mentioned, the accused has been facing trial for the commission of offences punishable under section 376 (2) of IPC and section 6 of POCSO Act. As per the case of the prosecution, the prosecutrix was raped by the accused since March 2015 till 19.06.2017, on several occasions, on the pretext of marriage, and also got pregnant, and the accused got her pregnancy terminated. PW1 (the prosecutrix) categorically stated that on 19.06.2017, on the day of the birthday of the accused, they had celebrated the birthday in her house and thereafter, they went for shopping. She stated that in the evening, after shopping, Rohit dropped her to her house. She also stated that she was asking him to marry her but he was not giving the clear answer and therefore, a quarrel took place between them, and on the next day when he did not pick up her phone, she went to the police station and told the police that she was having friendship with the accused for the last 4­5 years and he is not picking up her phone call. She categorically stated that the police obtained her signatures on some blank papers. She specifically stated that accused Rohit did not do any wrongful act with her and they were only friends. She stated that on 23.08.2017, she had married with the accused. In her cross­examination by the Ld. Prosecutor, she categorically denied the suggestion that in March 2015, at about 10:00am, when her mother had gone for job and her siblings were at school and she was alone, Rohit came to her house and he proposed her for marriage. She also denied the suggestions that thereafter, Rohit made physical relationship with her consent or that thereafter, she had also introduced Rohit with her mother or that Rohit also talked with her mother for their marriage and her mother had agreed for the same. She also denied the suggestion that on 05.01.2017, Rohit refused to marry her and told her that if she would pressurize to marry him, then he would defame her in her relations. PW1 (the prosecutrix) categorically denied the suggestion put by the Ld. Prosecutor that Rohit made physical relationship with her on the pretext of marriage after alluring and enticing her. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that Rohit has been making physical relationship with her for the last two years. She also denied the correctness of the suggestions that during the period December 2016 to March 2017, she also became pregnant and when she told the same to Rohit, he asked her to terminate the pregnancy or that on his persistent advice, she ate hot things due to which her pregnancy was terminated. She also denied the suggestion that on 19.06.2017, accused Rohit came to her house for celebrating his birthday and on the said day, he lastly made physical relationship with her. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that the site plan Ex.PW1/B was prepared by the police at her instance. As per the MLC report of the prosecutrix, the sexual assault history narrated to the doctor is 'consensual sexual intercourse with Mr. Rohit who promised to marry her, and the last sexual intercourse was held on 19.06.2017'. However, PW1 (the prosecutrix) also denied the correctness of the suggestion put by the Ld. Prosecutor that at the time of her medical examination by the doctor, she had told to the doctor that she had consensual sexual relationship with accused Rohit. On seeing her statement Ex.PW1/E under section 164 Cr.P.C., she voluntarily stated that she had given the said statement to the Magistrate on the advice of Priyanka Madam who was the police official, as she had told her that if she would not give the said statement, her marriage would not be solemnized with Rohit. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that she had told to the Magistrate all the true and correct facts voluntarily and on her own and not at the advice of the police official Priyanka. On the other hand, while evaluating the testimony of PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix), who is a hearsay witness, it reveals that she has also not supported the case of the prosecution at all, stating that her victim daughter was having friendly relations with Rohit being the neighbour, and her victim daughter did not tell her about her relationship with the accused Rohit or that Rohit has committed any wrongful act with her, and this witness was also cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor. In her cross­examination by the Ld. Prosecutor, PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix) denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor that her victim daughter had told her that she loved Rohit and wanted to marry him, or that on her insistence, her victim daughter told her that they had also made physical relationship with each other. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that on 20.06.2017, her victim daughter told her that Rohit and his family members are refusing to marry with her. She also denied having ever made statement Mark­PW2/A to the police. In view of the aforesaid discussions, particularly, keeping in view the testimony of PW1 (the prosecutrix), in my considered opinion, no useful purpose will be served by examining the remaining prosecution witnesses, as it will not affect the fate of the case. The other prosecution witnesses are formal witnesses, most of which are police officials. There is no medical and forensic evidence on record to prove the case of the prosecution that the accused had made physical relations with the victim. In these circumstances, continuing with this trial any further, will only result in wastage of time and resources, and there will be no impact on the result of this trial. Hence, the prosecution evidence has been closed and the SA of the accused has been dispensed with. In the overall facts and circumstances of the case and the aforesaid discussions, there being no evidence against the accused, accused Rohit @ Sonu is entitled to be acquitted, and accordingly, the accused is not found guilty of committing the offences punishable under sections 376 (2) of IPC and section 6 read with section 5 of POCSO Act, and consequently, he is acquitted of the said offences. However, Rohit @ Sonu is required to furnish bail bond in the sum of Rs.10,000/­ with one surety of like amount, under section 437A of Cr.P.C, which shall remain in force for a period of six months. The bail bonds are furnished and the same are accepted. File be consigned to Record Room, after necessary compliance.

HE HAS SOUGHT BAIL IN CONNECTION WITH A CASE REGISTERED AGAINST HIM IN CRIME NO.172/2017 FOR THE OFFENCES PUNISHABLE UNDER SECTION 376 OF IPC AND SECTIONS 4, 6 AND 8 OF POCSO ACT, 2012. 2. HEARD THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONER AND THE LEARNED HIGH COURT GOVERNMENT PLEADER APPEARING FOR THE RESPONDENT-STATE. 3. THE ALLEGATION FOUND AGAINST HIM IS THAT ON 20.3.2017 AT ABOUT 3.00 P.M. HE TOOK THE DAUGHTER OF THE COMPLAINANT AGED ABOUT 4 YEARS TO HIS HOUSE AND SEXUALLY ABUSED HER. A REPORT IN THIS REGARD WAS MADE AT 11.15 P.M. ON THE SAME DAY. 4. THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED AND CHARGE SHEET IS FILED. THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONER SUBMITS THAT THE STATEMENT OF THE GIRL UNDER SECTION 161 Cr.P.C. WAS RECORDED BY THE INVESTIGATION OFFICER TAKING THE HELP OF THE SOCIAL WORKER, AS THE VICTIM GIRL DOES NOT KNOW KANNADA. THE COMPLAINANT IS NORTH INDIAN. THEN HE REFERS TO THE REMAND APPLICATION TO ARGUE THAT IF REALLY THE STATEMENT OF THE VICTIM GIRL WAS RECORDED IN THE POLICE STATION ON 21.3.2017, A MENTION OF IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE REMAND APPLICATION DATED 22.3.2017. IT MAKES NO REFERENCE TO THE STATEMENT AND THEREFORE VERACITY OF THE STATEMENT RECORDED ON 21.3.2017 CAN BE DISBELIEVED.

HOWEVER HIS ANOTHER POINT OF ARGUMENT IF THE STATEMENT OF THE GIRL RECORDED BY THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER ON 21.3.2017 IS SEEN, IT WAS RECORDED IN THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN SOCIAL WORKER. HER ASSISTANCE WAS TAKEN BECAUSE CHILD DID NOT KNOW KANNADA AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRANSLATION SHE WAS ASKED TO ASSIST DURING THE INVESTIGATION. IT FURTHER SHOWS THAT THE VICTIM GIRL ANSWERED IN GADWALI LANGUAGE. THE FATHER OF THE GIRL TRANSLATED THE ANSWERS GIVEN BY THE CHILD IN GADWALI LANGUAGE INTO HINDI AND THEREAFTER HINDI VERSION WAS TRANSLATED INTO KANNADA. THEREFORE, AT THIS STAGE THE INTEREST OF THE CHILD FATHER IS FORTHCOMING. MOREOVER THE REMAND APPLICATION DATED 23.3.2017 SHOULD HAVE CONTAINED A REFERENCE TO THE STATEMENT DATED 21.3.2017 AND IT MAKES NO REFERENCE TO THIS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO INFER THAT VERACITY IN THE COMPLAINT AS WELL AS THE STATEMENT OF THE GIRL RECORDED ON 21.3.2017 CAN BE VIEWED WITH ASKANCE. PRIMA-FACIE MATERIALS CAN BE SAID NOT TO EXIST. THEREFORE, BAIL CAN BE GRANTED. SINCE THE PETITIONER IS FROM ODISSA STATE, HE NEEDS TO BE SUBJECTED TO STRINGENT CONDITIONS TO SEE THAT HE REGULARLY APPEARS BEFORE THE COURT TILL TRIAL IS CONCLUDED.

On a complaint lodged by the petitioner, the respondent Police registered a case in Cr.No.290 of 2015 for the offence under Section 4 of POCSO Act and Sections 294 (b) and 506(i) IPC against Srinivasan, who was arrested by Police and has now been released on bail. It is the grievance of the petitioner that the investigation is not going on a right line and therefore, he sought for transfer of the same to any Specialized Agency. This Court perused the case diary. Statement of the victim girl has been recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. and she has also been subjected to medical examination. It is the further grievance of the petitioner that the Police have not taken any steps to have the DNA Profiling done between the accused and child. A copy of the statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. is not available in the case diary. In a case of this nature, it would be sufficient, if the victim girl gives evidence with general corroboration from other sources. Under such circumstances, this Court is of the view, it is not a fit case to transfer the investigation to any other agency. Under such circumstances, this Court, in the interest of justice, directs the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Madhuranthagam, to supervise the investigation in Cr.No.290 of 2015.

Petitioner -vs- State Represented by The Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station-Udhagamandalam, Udhagamandalam, Nilgiris District. (Crime No.1 of 2015) .. Respondent Petition filed under Section 389(1) of Cr.P.C., to suspend the sentence of imprisonment passed in Spl. S.C.No.4 of 2015 dated 27.11.2015 by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Udhagamandalam, Nilgiris District and release the petitioner on bail pending disposal of the Criminal Appeal. For Petitioner : Mr.J.T.Rajasuriya For Respondent : Mr.P.Govindarajan, Additional Public Prosecutor. O R D E R The sole accused in the Special Sessions Case in Spl. S.C.No.4 of 2015 on the file of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Nilgiris District at Udhagamandalam seeks suspension of his sentence of imprisonment. In the said Court, after trial, the trial Court convicted the accused under Section 7 read with Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (hereinafter POCSO Act) and sentenced him 3 years R.I. and fined him Rs.5,000/- and directed him to pay a compensation of Rs.1,00,000/-, i/d 2 years RI. The learned Judge also directed him payment of further compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- out of Victim Assistance Fund. PW-2 is the daughter of PW-1. The accused has been prosecuted for he having sexually abused her. The Trial Court believed her and construed his act as a sexual assault and thus convicted and sentenced him as stated above. The learned counsel for the petitioner/appellant would contend that the petitioner as well as the accused fancied each other. They fell in love. To distance him from her daughter, PW-1 had engineered this case. The prosecution version is the concocted brainchild of PW-1 in an unholistic alliance with the obliging police. The learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that in this case the two instances of occurrence have been projected. However, on this aspect, there is material contradictions as between the mother (P.W.1) and the daughter/P.W.2. It is PW-1 vs. PW-2. The learned counsel for the petitioner would also contend that top of it, there is material variation in the testimony of PW-2 before and during trial. Before trial before a Magistrate under Section 164 Cr.P.C. So also in her police statement. P.Ws.-2 and 1 were inconsistent as to the alleged date of occurrence, more particularly, PW-1 introduces a date, namely, 5.3.2015 which is nobody's case. 5.3.2015 was not uttered either by PW-2 nor prosecution. Thus, PW-1's version is a coloured version. In such circumstances, placing implicit reliance on the testimony of PWs-1 and 2 and inflict punishment upon the accused is too dangerous. Thus, there is prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. He will not run away. He has no bad history/antecedents. In the circumstances, he may be granted appeal bail. On the other hand, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that the Court can keep aside PW-1 because she is not the victim and focus its attention mainly on the victim/PW-2. Her evidence is crystal clear that the accused prayed on PW-2 like a vulture. He committed the inhuman act upon a minor child. Her solemn statement as to the sexual violence committed upon her. There is no significant reason for PW-1 as against the accused to implicate the accused risking the life and future of unmarried school going minor daughter. Very grave allegations are made as against the accused. There is no prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. This case is not a fit case for the grant of appeal bail. I have anxiously considered the rival submissions, perused the Trial Court's judgment and the piece of evidence referred to by both sides. In the facts and circumstances, now the question is whether the petitioner could be granted appeal bail under Section 389(1) Cr.P.C. Regular bail in a non-bailable offence in fit cases are being granted by the Magistrates under Section 437 Cr.P.C. While other Courts and the High Court exercises concurrent jurisdiction to grant bail in non-bailable cases under Section 439 Cr.P.C. The remand prisoners, under-trials could seek bail under the said provisions during pre-conviction stage of a criminal case. During that stage, it is pertinent to note that the presumption of innocence of an accused is intact because everyone is presumed to be innocent till the guilt alleged against the accused is proved beyond all reasonable doubts. However, once conviction is recorded, the said presumption is replaced by a Criminal Court judgment. Thereafter, also the conviction person can seek bail under Section 389 (1) Cr.P.C. Thus, the consideration for the grant of bail to an accused during the pre-conviction stage (before judgment) and post-conviction stage (after judgment) are different. So far as appeal bail under Section 389(1) Cr.P.C. is concerned, the Court has to find out is there any prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. While doing so, the Court should not indulge in meticulous examination of the evidence of the accused because the main appeal is not heard. It is still pending. To find out the prima facie case, the Trial Court has to refer to the findings recorded by the trial Court and the relevant evidence referred to. Further, it must also take into account the nature of the accusation made as against the accused. In view of the large scale violence committed upon the children, in 2012, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (Act No.32 of 2012) has been enacted. It is a Central Act. It contains provisions ensuring confidentiality of the victim of the offence, her family details and also conducting of the trial in a child friendly atmosphere and it had also introduced a legal fiction as to the criminal propensity, mental faculty of the accused, through Sections 29 and 30(1) of the Act. However, under Section 30(2), the Act one's right of presumption of innocence until he is otherwise held guilty by legal evidence has been preserved. Thus, it is Indianised version of admixture of English Criminal Law (Common System of Law) and French Criminal Law (Continental System of Law). Now, in a prosecution launched under POCSO Act, age of the victim is very important because only upon the victim being below 18 years that she is a 'child' the stringent provisions of POCSO Act will apply and consent of the victim being immaterial under POCSO Act. POCSO Act is much more wider in scope in prosecuting an accused than prosecuting accused under Section 376 IPC. In this case, start of the offence was stated to be on 21.2.2015 in the house of PW-1, when her mother was away. During that time, PW-2 was studying VIII Standard in a school. It is stated that then she was 13 years old. Ex.P-3 School Certificate, Ex.P-8 Medical Certificate, Ex.P-9 age Certificate and the evidence of PW-7 School Headmaster and PW-5 Doctor beyond pale of any controversy establishes that at the time when the alleged occurrence took place, she was below 18 years. So she is a child within the meaning of Section 2(d) of POCSO Act. So the provisions of POCSO Act became applicable to this case. PW-2 is stated to be the victim of a sexual violence. Her evidence shall be treated as the evidence of an injured witness. If her evidence is consistent, cogent, unimpeachable unless there are acceptable reasons to implicate the accused, her evidence can be acted upon. The question of looking for corroboration for her evidence arises when her evidence appears to be murky. This is a rule of prudence and not a rule of law. Thus, corroboration cannot be insisted upon as a condition precedent to act on the testimony of a victim in a sexual violence case. But while appreciating their evidence, the Court must fathom out the reality of the situation and the truth of the allegations. While doing so, the Court cannot mistake every difference in evidence as a material contradiction. It cannot go blow out a contradiction beyond proportion. It cannot mistook a mole a mountain. In a sexual violence case, honour of two persons, namely, the victim as well as the accused is involved. When the allegations are very serious, the Court must be very serious of proving those allegations. Even to impute culpable mental state to the accused, there must be some material for the Court to have reason to believe the existence of such a fact (See Sections 29 and 30(2) of POCSO Act, 2012). Now, in this case, PW-2 the minor child had the countenance of the accused, a Book-Seller for the first time when he came to their house to market his books. PW-1 forewarned him not to visit again since there are ladies in her house. According to PW-2, on the fateful day, namely, on 21.2.2015, at about 2 p.m., while she was alone in her house, the accused came, pressed her breasts, pushed her to the bed, sexually abused her private parts by placing his private part. Subsequently, on 28.3.2015 around 2 p.m., when again the accused came to her house with similar motive, PW-2 raised alarm, the accused took to his heels, PW-1 came, PW-2 recounted the whole incident and also the earlier incident that took place on 21.2.2015. Thereafter, police complaint was lodged. Thereafter, medical examination was conducted and there was no presence of external injuries on her private part. It is pertinent to note that the actual physical violence was not on 28.3.2015. Even as per the version of PW-2, it was on 21.2.2015 and thus, by the time the medical examination was conducted more than a month had passed away, the evidence on her person had fade away. PW-2, being a child was under extreme trauma, normally a child like her, when placed in such grim situation, will not be forthcoming and will try to hide the shame. But, in this case, as per PW-2 when again the accused attempted to make her sexual assault on her, unable to put up with the shame, she cried and the accused was caught. Reading the evidence of PWs-2 and 1 and other witnesses and the complaint, the substratum of the case that the accused on the first occasion had sexually assaulted the victim has been brought out by the prosecution. The attempt of the defence to dilute the effect of the said evidence by clinging to some difference in the evidence of PWs-1 and 2 and in the statement of the victim girl recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. which are not so material and are not significant enough to shake the veracity of the testimony of the victim girl has not been shattered by this adventure of the defence which has become a misadventure. Further, there is no convincing reason or motive supported by any material or acceptable reason to view the evidence of PW-2 with a jaundiced eye. The nature of the allegations made as against the accused is very serious. Thus, the fallout is that there is no prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. Thus, I am not inclined to grant him appeal bail. In view of the foregoings, this petition is dismissed. However, it is made clear that the observations made in this order are only for the purpose of finding out a prima facie case to take a decision in this petition and it has nothing to do with the disposal of the main Criminal Appeal.", "question_canonical": "What does the legal interpretation of the statements made during the trial and their compared differences reveal about the credibility of the victim's testimony in sexual offenses against minors as outlined in the passage, and how are potential contradictions evaluated by the court?", "options": {"A": "Contradictions in the victim's testimony always lead to an automatic dismissal of the case.", "B": "Minor inconsistencies may not be significant enough to undermine the victim's credibility.", "C": "All discrepancies in testimonies are treated as major contradictions requiring dismissal of the case.", "D": "Victim testimonies are not considered credible if they are not corroborated by multiple witnesses."}, "correct_answer_text": "Minor inconsistencies may not be significant enough to undermine the victim's credibility.", "rationale_statutory": "The passage explains that while the court must evaluate the credibility of testimonies in a sexual violence case, not every minor difference in evidence constitutes a material contradiction.

The first informant did not take it seriously. Again on the next day, when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, she told her not to pour warm water on her private part as she was having burning sensation. Again in the afternoon when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, she told her that she was having pain and burning sensation in her private part. When she enquired with her daughter, her daughter informed that on 23.07.2016 when she had gone to the house of the neighbour uncle [accused] for watching T.V., at that time, he lifted her and inserted his finger on her private part and tickled her. Thereafter, at about 2.00 p.m., when the first informant and her daughter were in the front yard, at that time, her daughter showed the accused and told her that he is the one who took her inside the house and inserted the finger in her private part and tickled her. On the basis of the aforesaid complaint lodged by the mother of the victim girl, a case was registered in Crime No.192/2016 of Konaje Police Station against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(a) and 4 of the POCSO Act, 2012, by P.W.11 and he issued Ex.P6-FIR to the jurisdictional Court and thereafter handed over the investigation to P.W.13-Police Inspector. P.W.13 proceeded with the investigation and conducted spot-mahazar as per Ex.P2. The victim girl was sent for medical examination and her medical examination was conducted by P.W.4. The statement of the victim girl was recorded by the Magistrate under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. The articles collected during the course of investigation were sent for forensic examination. After completion of the investigation, charge-sheet was filed against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(a) and 4 of the POCSO Act. Initially, charges were framed against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(b) and 4 of the POCSO Act on 27.04.2017. Additional charges were framed for the offence punishable under Sections 5(m) and 6 of the POCSO Act. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against him and claimed to be tried. Before the trial Court, the prosecution got examined P.Ws.1 to 15 and got marked Exs.P1 to 9 and M.O.1. The accused denied all the incriminating evidence appeared against him while his statement was recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. However, the accused did not choose to lead any evidence on his behalf. The learned Sessions Judge after considering the evidence and material on record, convicted and sentenced the accused for the offence under Section 5(m) punishable under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. Aggrieved by the same, the present appeal has been preferred. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant/accused has vehemently contended that the impugned Judgment and Order passed by the trial Court is opposed to law, facts and probabilities of the case. The trial Court has committed grave error in convicting the accused though the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. He submits that on account of previous enmity, a false complaint was lodged against the accused. There is an inordinate delay in lodging the complaint. The medical evidence does not corroborate with the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. The victim has been tutored by her parents to give false evidence against the accused, which is evident from her cross-examination. He submits that the trial Court has erred in observing that the contradictions in a child's testimony should not be given the same effect as in the testimony of an adult by ignoring the admission given by the victim that she was tutored by her mother to give evidence as deposed by her. He submits that the evidence of the victim girl clearly shows that she was acting under the influence of her parents and therefore, she is a tutored witness. Hence, it is not safe to act upon such evidence particularly when the medical evidence does not corroborate with the evidence of the victim. He therefore submits that the impugned Judgment and Order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court be set aside and the appeal be allowed...", "question_canonical": "In a situation involving a minor, what is the significance of medical evidence in a child abuse case under the POCSO Act, and how did the court evaluate the medical findings related to the victim's complaint?

{"id": "real-315", "passage": "Muthu Kumar vs The State on 31 January, 2025. This Criminal Appeal arises out of the judgment of conviction and sentence rendered by the learned Sessions Judge, Special Court for Exclusive Trial of Cases under the POSCO Act, Chennai, in Spl.S.C.No.195 of 2022, dated 31.10.2023. The appellant was tried along with one Bhuvaneswari (A2), the mother of the victim girl. The learned trial Judge found A2 guilty for the offence under Section 6 read with Section 17 @ 21(1) of the POCSO Act and convicted and sentenced her to undergo imprisonment for four months, and the period of detention already undergone has been set off under Section 428 Cr.P.C. The victim, P.W.2, who was born on 15.09.2004, was a minor at the time of the incident. She had been living with her mother (A2) since her father separated from the family, taking the victim's brother with him. The appellant, an auto driver, came into contact with the victim's family when he began providing transportation. Later, he informed the victim's mother that he had divorced his wife, and the appellant and A2 began living together with the victim girl. Taking advantage of the mother's absence, the appellant forcibly committed penetrative sexual assault on the victim girl. This abuse continued, and the victim later became pregnant. She gave birth to a male child at home, and when complications arose with the umbilical cord, the victim sought medical treatment. This led to the involvement of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and the Police, bringing the crime to light. Following medical treatment, the Primary Health Centre staff, Nammalwarpet reported the case to the CWC after discovering the victim's pregnancy and minor status. The CWC informed the Police, and thereafter, the case was registered in Crime No.11 of 2022 against the accused for the offences under Sections 5(j)(ii), 6 and 17 of the POCSO Act. During the investigation, the victim's statement was recorded. Subsequently, the victim was produced before a doctor and a Magistrate, where her statement under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C. was recorded. After recording statements from the witnesses and collecting the materials, the accused were arrested. A charge sheet was filed before the trial Court, listing 14 witnesses. Upon completion of the trial, the trial Court convicted the appellant (A1) under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. The second accused (A2) was convicted under Section 6 read with Section 17 @ 21 (1) of the POCSO Act. The learned counsel for the appellant contends that the trial Court's finding is contrary to both the law and the weight of the evidence. The learned counsel submits that the trial Court failed to properly consider the statement made by the victim, P.W.2, who categorically stated that she and the appellant had got married, and that a male child was born out of their relationship. According to P.W.2, she and the appellant were living together as husband and wife. P.W.2 further stated that their baby developed an infection in the umbilical cord, and the baby was taken to the Public Health Centre for treatment. From there, information was sent to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), which, according to the learned counsel, did not conduct a proper enquiry and rushed into action by lodging a complaint. The victim hails from a marginalized background and lives in poverty. It is the appellant's family that takes care of the victim, supports her, and provides aid in all aspects. In the result, the criminal appeal is allowed; the conviction and sentences imposed on the appellant/A1 by judgment dated 31.10.2023, in Spl.S.C.No.195 of 2022, by the learned Sessions Judge, Special Court for Exclusive Trial of Cases under the POCSO Act, Chennai, is set aside and he is acquitted from all the charges.", "question_canonical": "What are the implications of the judgment in the case of Muthu Kumar vs The State on potential future cases involving minors under the POSCO Act, particularly in regards to the treatment and consideration of the victim’s statements and the actions of child welfare authorities?

He also\n  used to take photographs and videos of their intimate acts.\n  Later, their relationship became strained when the applicant\n  started to have a liking towards another girl. It is alleged\n  that   when   the    victim questioned the applicant,   he\n  threatened her with the photographs and videos which were\n  in his possession.    This tormented the minor girl and she\n  decided to take her own life.        Initially, the Crime was\n  registered on 23.3.2018 under Section 174 of the Cr.P.C.\n  Later, on the basis of an additional statement given by the\n  brother of the victim, the offences under the       POCSO Act\n  and other grave offences under the IPC were incorporated.\n4.The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submits that\n  a detailed statement of the brother of the victim as well as\n  all the near relatives were recorded immediately after the\n  registration of the Crime. No one had a case that the\n  applicant herein had anything to do with the minor girl. It\n  was much later, i.e., on 3.4.2018, the allegation of sexual\n  abuse and other grave acts were raised by the brother. The\ndrastical turnaround would affect the credibility of his version\n  is the submission. Finally, it is submitted that the applicant\n  was arrested on 05.04.2018 and having regard to the period\n  of incarceration undergone and the stage of investigation,\n  he be released.\n5.The learned Public Prosecutor while opposing the prayer\n  submitted that the allegations are extremely grave. The\n applicant herein is a near relative of the victim girl and there\n is no reason to believe the version of the brother of the\n victim. It is submitted that the applicant by feigning love\n have sexually abused the minor child.\n6. I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone\n  through the materials and records. Though the allegations\n  are grave, the fact remains that the investigation has made\n  much headway and has reached the final stages. As\n  submitted by the learned counsel, the brother of the victim\n  did not state before the investigating officer while furnishing\n  his initial statement that on the day prior to the death of the\n  child, he had an occasion to interact with her and that she\n  had divulged about the horrendous acts committed by the\n  applicant.\n7.Having regard to the nature and gravity of the allegations,\n  the material in support thereof, the stage of investigation\n  and the period of incarceration undergone, I am of the view\n  that the applicant can now be enlarged on bail.\n8.In the result, this application will stand allowed. The\n  applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond\n  for Rs.1,00,000/-(Rupees One lakh only) with two solvent\n  sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court\n  having jurisdiction.

Applicant is in judicial custody since 16.10.2024. As per the case of prosecution, Alagraj and the child-in-conflict with law went to the house of their relative (brother-in-law of Alagraj), Ajay Singh on 14.07.2024 and abused him in filthy language for meeting his sister - Jatani. Alagraj assaulted Ajay Singh with wooden stick. Alagraj caught hold of Ajay Singh and the child-in-conflict with law assaulted him with knife. Sakku, Anu Bai and Jatani rescued him. Ajay was admitted at M.Y. Hospital, Indore, and was under treatment from 14.07.2024 to 20.07.2024. After discharge from the hospital, Ajay Singh reported the incident to Outpost Mangalia of P.S.

This petition seeking an order of pre-arrest bail is preferred by the accused in Crime No.42 of 2018 of the Hosdurg Police Station, registered under Sections 366 and 377 of the Indian Penal Code and under Sections 5(I), (m) and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO'). 2. The aforesaid crime was registered on the basis of information furnished by a minor girl who was studying in the IV Standard. She used to travel to the School in the autorickshaw of the petitioner herein. The child in her statement has stated in clear and unambiguous terms that while she was in the III and IV standard, the petitioner used to sexually assault her on multiple occasions. It is further alleged that on 11.1.2018, the victim was taken to the residential home of the petitioner herein and after removing her clothes, she was subjected to gross sexual abuse. 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the allegations are without basis. According to the learned counsel, even if the allegations are admitted as such, offence under Section 5 r/w. Section 6 of the Act will not be made out. It is further alleged that other crimes have also been registered at the instance of the minor child which would render her case against the petitioner suspect. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer. It is submitted that the medical examination report of the victim reveal that she was subjected to sexual abuse. 5. I have considered the submissions advanced. 6. Having regard to facts and circumstances, the contention of the learned counsel that the petitioner is totally innocent cannot be countenanced. The medical certificate of the injured sufficiently corroborates the case of the prosecution. In that view of the matter, it does not appear to me that this Court will be justified in arming the petitioner with an order of pre-arrest bail. 7. However, the learned counsel prays for a direction that the petitioner be allowed to surrender before the jurisdictional court. I do not see any need for issuance of any such directions. The petitioner shall surrender as expeditiously as possible and if an application for bail is filed, the same shall be considered and orders shall be passed on its merits.

Respondent(s) For Applicants(s) : Shri Akshay Sail, Advocate For Respondent/State : Ms.Pragya Shrivastava, Dy.GA (Hon'ble Shri Justice Arvind Kumar Verma) Order on Board 25/03/2025 As the above three M.Cr.Cs. are arising out of the same Crime Number, they are being disposed of by this common order. 2. The applicants have filed this bail application under Section 483 of the Bhartiya Nagrrik Suraksha Sanhita for grant of regular bail as they are in custody in connection with Crime No. 256/2024 registered at police station Mahasamund, District Mahasamund (CG) for the offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(n), 376(3), 506 Part-II/34 of IPC, Section 6 of the POCSO and Section 67 of the IT Act. 3. Prosecution case in brief is that report was lodged against the applicants on 19.05.2024 alleging that the applicants took the prosecutrix to the doctor on 17.05.2024 as she was complaining of stomach ache and on examination, she was found pregnant. Thereafter on 18.05.2024, she was admitted at Aditya Hospital, Mahasamund for treatment. It is the case of prosecution that the applicant in M.Cr.C. No. 1463/2025 were having love affair and on 21.01.2024 they developed physical relations and the co-accused persons helped the applicant in the said offence. Based on the said report two more Crime Nos. were registered against two different persons namely Rajendra Sahu and Tulsi Sahu (Cr. Nos. 257/2024 and 258/2024) respectively. On the basis of the said report, the police registered the offence against the accused persons and they were arrested. 4. Counsel for the applicants submits that the applicants have been falsely implicated in the case. He further contended that the FIR was lodged with a delay of about 5 months. It is contended that the incident took place on 19.01.2024 and 21.01.2024 whereas the FIR was lodged on 19.05.2024. It is contended that two more FIRs have been registered against two others of the same offence of sexual assault and therefore the testimony of the prosecutrix not credible and creates doubt as she has narrated different stories in her statements. It is submitted that the accused Rajendra Sahu in Crime No. 257/2024 has been granted bail by this Court in M.Cr.C. No. 6869/2024 vide order dated 08.01.2025, therefore the present applicants may also be granted similar benefit. 5. It is contended on behalf of the applicants namely, Ashik Nishad and Ganesh Nishad in M.Cr.C. Nos. 1464/2025 and 1467/2025 receptively that they have only assisted the applicant Guman Nishad in the commission of rape. Lastly, it is submitted that the charge sheet has been filed, they are in jail since 20.05.2024 and the trial is likely to take some time, they are ready and willing to comply with any of the conditions which may be imposed upon them and thus, it is submitted that the application be allowed and the applicants be released on bail. 6. Learned counsel for the respondent/State, on the other hand, has opposed the bail applications and submits that applicant Ashik Nishad in M.Cr.C. No1464/2025 had transmitted in the electronic form and made it viral. 7. Heard counsel for the parties and perused the record. 8. From perusal of the prosecution case, the accused Guman Nishad had developed physical relation with the victim, she became pregnant and thereafter when her parents came to know about the incident, the report was lodged. However, after the victim gave birth to a child and DNA test was done and as per the report, applicant was not the biological father of the child. 9. Here in the present case, though the applicant had denied to have made any physical relation with the prosecutrix but considering the fact that it was not the first occasion when the complaint was made by the prosecutrix for committing rape but in the same vein she made similar type of allegations against other persons also. Thus, taking into consideration the fact that they are in jail since 20.05.2024, charge sheet has been filed and that the final disposal of the trial is likely to take sufficiently long time, the present applications deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, their bail applications are allowed. 10. It is directed that in the event of applicants' executing a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 10,000/- each with one surety to the satisfaction of the concerned trial court, they shall be released on bail on the following conditions: I) they shall file an undertaking to the effect that he/she shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in the Court. IN case of default of this condition, it shall be open for the trial court to treat it as abuse of liberty of bail and pass orders in accordance with law. ii) they shall remain present before the trial court on each date fixed, either personally or through his/her counsel. In case of his absence without sufficient cause, the trial court may proceed against him/her under Section 269 of BNS, 2023. iii) In case, the applicants misuse the liberty of bail during trial and in order to secure his/her presence, proclamation under Section 84 of the BNSS, 2023 is issued and the applicants failed to appear before the court on the date fixed in such proclamation, then, the trial court shall initiate proceedings against him/her. In accordance with law under Section 209 of BNS, 2023. iv) The applicants shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on the dates fixed for (i) opening of the case (ii) framing of charge and (iii) recording of statement under Section 351 of BNSS, 2023.If in the opinion of the trial court absence of the applicants are deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him/her in accordance with law.

This revision petition is arising out of the concurrent findings of the Courts below wherein the Trial Court recorded the conviction of the petitioner under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of Indian Penal Code (for short 'IPC'). In the appeal, the Appellate Court allowed the appeal partly and set aside the judgment of conviction in respect of the provision under Section 504 of IPC and confirmed the sentences of the remaining provisions. Being aggrieved by the same, the petitioner herein has preferred this revision petition. 2. The rank of the parties in the Trial Court will be considered henceforth for convenience. Brief facts of the case are as under: 3. It is the case of the prosecution that, on 12.12.2011 at about 11.00 a.m., at Machihalli Koracharahatti village, Government Anganavadi school, when the complainant was discharging her duties as a Anganavadi Teacher, the accused went there and picked up quarrel with the complainant by stating that she should not have informed the marriage which he had intended to marry the minor girl, who is aged about 14 years, to the Women and Child Welfare Department, Harapanahalli. The accused abused in a filthy language and slapped her on the face and asked her to marry him and also assaulted her and pulled her saree and outraged her modesty. Further he has threatened her with dire consequences. Based on the complaint lodged by the complainant, the respondent / police have registered a case in Crime No.175/2011 for the offences punishable under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of IPC. After investigation, the respondent / police have submitted the charge sheet. 4. To prove the case of the prosecution, the prosecution examined 6 witnesses as PWs.1 to 6 and got marked 7 documents as Exs.P1 to P7. Both the Courts have concurrently held that the petitioner committed the offences stated supra and recorded the conviction. Hence this revision petition. 5. Heard Shri R.B.Deshpande, learned counsel for the petitioner and Shri Rahul Rai K, learned High Court Government Pleader for the respondent - State. 6. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that, the concurrent findings recorded by the Courts below in convicting the petitioner / accused appears to be perverse, illegal and the same is liable to be set aside. 7. It is further submitted that there are no independent witnesses to the said incident. The complainant deliberately exaggerated the incident as if the petitioner has outraged her modesty and narrated in her complaint which is beyond truth. It is further submitted that the prosecution has not produced any document to show that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl. In the absence of the said document, it is not appropriate to arrive at a conclusion that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl / victim and the same was informed to the Women and Child Welfare Department. The said aspect should have been considered by the Courts below before recording the conviction. 8. It is further submitted that the Trial Court convicted the petitioner on the basis of the surmises and conjectures which are alien to the criminal jurisprudence. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Courts below are required to be set aside. Making such submission, learned counsel for the petitioner prays to allow the petition. 9. Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader (for short 'HCGP) for the respondent-State vehemently justified the concurrent findings and submitted that the name of the victim with whom the marriage of the accused was proposed to be carried out, was studying at Kasturba Residential School and the said proposed marriage was informed to the complainant. After receiving the said information, the complainant has informed the same to the Women and Child Welfare Department. Due to the said enmity, the petitioner has committed the offences as stated supra. Both the Courts have concurrently held that the petitioner has committed the offences and therefore, interference with the said findings may not be appropriate and not required. Making such submission, learned HCGP prays to dismiss the petition. 10. Having heard the submissions of learned counsels for the respective parties and also perused the findings of the Courts below in recording the conviction, it is the case of the prosecution that the marriage between the petitioner and the minor girl was fixed and it was brought to the notice of PW.1 by the villagers. The complainant has informed the said fact to the higher authority. The petitioner after having learnt that PW.1 has informed the same to the higher officials, he has gone to the office of PW.1 and started abusing, assaulting and insulting PW.1 in one or other pretext and said to have committed the offences as stated supra. 11. Having regard to the scope and ambit of the Revisional jurisdiction in interfering with the findings of the Courts below, it is appropriate to have a cursory look upon the evidence of all the witnesses, to ascertain as to whether any error committed by the Courts below in appreciating both oral and documentary evidence on record. 12. PW.1 being a Teacher who was working at Machihalli Anganvadi. On 12.12.2011, when she was working at the Anganvadi, she has learnt that the marriage of the minor girl was fixed with the petitioner and she had informed the same to the higher officials who visited the house of the victim / minor girl. Being enraged of the visit of the higher officials to the house of the minor girl, the petitioner went to Anganvadi Centre and questioned her as to why she has stopped the marriage and said to have pulled her saree, assaulted her in front of others. By that time, CW.4 intervened and pacified the matter. Thereafter, PW.1 went to the police station and lodged a complaint against the petitioner. She was cross-examined at length and she has admitted that she had not gone to the marriage negotiations proposed to be held between the petitioner and the minor girl. In spite of lengthy cross-examination being subjected to PW.1, PW.1 withstood the same and supported the case of the prosecution. 13. PW.2 - an independent witness, supported the case of the prosecution and narrated the incident as how the petitioner had assaulted PW.1 and the manner in which he has outraged her modesty. When a specific question was put to her that she is a relative of PW.1, she has admitted the relationship. However, she has assertively stated that the incident had taken place in her presence and she has seen the assault having been made by the petitioner. 14. PW.3 - witness to spot panchanama, which is marked as Ex.P2 and he has supported the case of the prosecution. 15. PW.4 also witness to Ex.P2 and supported the case of the prosecution. 16. PW.5 - Doctor who treated PW.1, issued wound certificate as per Ex.P5. As per the said wound certificate, PW.1 sustained three injuries. Though several suggestions are made about the methods and possibilities of sustaining the injuries, he has supported the case of the prosecution. 17. PW.6 was working as PSI, stated to have received the complaint on 12.12.2011 and conducted the investigation and submitted the charge sheet. 18. As per the averments of the complaint and also the evidence of PWs.1 and 2, the incident said to have taken place on 12.12.2011, on the same day, a complaint came to be registered by the complainant. The FIR was sent to the Jurisdictional Magistrate on the same date at 05.20 p.m. The evidence of PWs.1 and 2 are clinching and reliable. These two witnesses have been subjected to lengthy cross-examination; however, nothing has been elicited to disbelieve their version. In addition to their evidence, the evidence of the Doctor - PW.5 who treated PW.1 and issued wound certificate as per Ex.P5 which clearly indicates that PW.1 sustained injuries. The incident had taken place when she was discharging her official duty as Anganvadi Teacher. 19. The prosecution even though examined PWs.1 and 2 as witnesses to the incident, no independent witnesses have neither been cited nor examined as witnesses to the incident. As per the case of the prosecution, the alleged incident said to have taken place in the village, if such incident had taken place in the Anganvadi, certainly many people would have gathered, either to witness the incident or to pacify the same. Not citing the independent witnesses in such incident by the Investigating Officer, which appears to be strange and unbelievable. 20. The motive for the said incident is that PW.1 has informed to the higher officials regarding the proposed marriage of the petitioner with a minor girl. The prosecution has failed to produce any document to show that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl and further the prosecution failed to cite the officials of the Department of Women and Child Welfare to substantiate the case. When the prosecution has failed to establish the motive for commission of such offence, the commission of offence appears to be doubtful and it may be said that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt and therefore, the petitioner is entitled for acquittal in this case. However, the Courts below have failed to take note of these aspects and recorded the conviction which appears to be erroneous and not proper. Therefore, the conviction has to be set aside. 21. In the light of the above observations, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER (i) The Criminal Revision Petition is allowed. (ii) The judgment and order dated 11.07.2013 passed in CC.No.378/2012 by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Harapanahalli and the judgment and order dated 21.07.2017 passed in Cml.A.No.78/2013 by the I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Davanagere are set aside. (iii) The petitioner is acquitted for the offences punishable under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of IPC. (iv) Bail bonds executed, if any, stand cancelled.

{"id": "real-495", "passage": "Raju Kumar Singh vs State on 20 May, 2016\n\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI\n\nRESERVED ON : MAY 16, 2016\nDECIDED ON : MAY 20, 2016\n\nCrl.A.1032/2015\n\nRAJU KUMAR SINGH ..... Appellant\n\nVERSUS\n\nSTATE ..... Respondent\n\nCORAM:\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S.P.GARG\n\nS.P.GARG, J.\n\n1. The appellant Raju Kumar Singh has challenged the legality and correctness of a judgment dated 19.08.2015 of learned Additional Sessions Judge in Sessions Case No.72/14 arising out of FIR No.166/14 registered at Police Station Shalimar Bagh by which he was held guilty for committing offence punishable under Section 342 IPC and Sections 10 and 12 of POCSO Act. By an order dated 25.08.2015, he was sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for five years with fine `5,000/- under Section 10 of POCSO Act; Rigorous Imprisonment for two months with fine `500/- under Section 342 IPC; and, Rigorous Imprisonment for one year with fine `1,000/- under Section 12 of POCSO AC. The sentences were to operate concurrently.\n2. The incident whereby the child was sexually abused was reported to the police via Daily Diary (DD) No.87B (Ex.PW-3/A) on 21.02.2014 at around 10.50 p.m. The Investigating Officer after recording the statement of victim's mother (Ex.PW-4/A) lodged First Information Report. The prosecutrix was medically examined; she recorded her 164 Cr.P.C. statement. The accused was arrested. Statements of witnesses conversant with the facts were recorded. Upon completion of investigation, a charge-sheet was filed against the appellant for commission of various offences in the court. To substantiate its case, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses. The appellant denied his involvement in the crime and pleaded false implication; he did not produce any evidence in defence. The trial resulted in his conviction as aforesaid. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied, the instant appeal has been filed.\n3. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the file. The occurrence took place during daytime at around 3.30 p.m. when victim's mother Manju was away at her place of work. When she returned in the evening at around 8.30 p.m., the victim narrated the incident to her. She immediately went to the appellant's house but he was not present there. On his arrival at around 10.00-10.30 p.m., she confronted and slapped him. The incident was reported immediately to the police and DD No.87-B came into existence. In her statement (Ex.Pw-4/A), Manju gave a detailed account as to how and in what manner, her daughter 'X' (changed name) aged around five years was sexually assaulted by the appellant in her absence. The appellant was named in the FIR to be the perpetrator of the crime. In 164 Cr.P.C. statement (Ex.PW-2/F), the victim disclosed that the accused had taken her inside his room and had touched her private parts. She further disclosed that the accused had put off her underwear and had touched her private parts with tongue. In her 164 Cr.P.C. statement (Ex.PW-2/B), the complainant Manju also reiterated her version given to the police at first instance and implicated the accused to be the author of the crime.\n4. Before recording her Court statement, the victim was asked various questions to find out if she was able to give rational answers to the questions put to her. The Presiding Officer after recording satisfaction that 'X' was competent to give her statement voluntarily, recorded her statement. She categorically attributed specific role to the accused in outraging her modesty in his house. She deposed that the accused had put off his underwear; he had also put off her underwear and touched her private parts; he had shown her nude photos on his mobile and had touched her private parts with his tongue. In the cross-examination, she disclosed that on the arrival of her mother, she apprised her about the occurrence. She further elaborated that the accused had done 'gandi baat' with her sister too and had shown her nude photos. She denied if the statement given by her in the court was tutored by her mother.\n5. PW-4 (Manju), victim's mother corroborated her version in its entirety without any major variation. The statement of 'Y' (assumed name), victim's sister, was recorded as CW-1. In her statement 'Y' too deposed that the accused had taken her inside his house along with her sister 'X'; had shown her nude photos on his mobile; had disrobed her sister 'X'; and, had put off his underwear. In the cross-examination, she denied if she had given statement at the behest of her parents.\n6. On scanning the testimonies of all these witnesses, it stands established that they are consistent throughout and despite cross-examination, nothing material could be extracted to disbelieve them. The witnesses had no ulterior motive to falsely implicate the accused for the heinous offence. They have corroborated each other without any inconsistencies and infirmities. The incident was reported without delay and the appellant was named to be the perpetrator of the crime. Specific and defined role was assigned to him. The accused taking advantage of the loneliness of the small children in the house had dared to outrage their modesty. It has come on record that victim's father Sunil was confined in Tihar Jail in a decoity case. Her mother used to go at her place of work during daytime. It gave an opportunity to the appellant living in the neighborhood to exploit the innocence of the children. In the absence of any prior animosity or enmity, the victims and their mother are not expected to falsely implicate the appellant in a case of sexual abuse to bring themselves in disrepute. The defense put up by the accused deserves outright rejection. Nothing has come on record to show if on any particular date `10,000/- were borrowed by victim's father from him or that to avoid the said payment, the accused was falsely implicated in this case. For a trivial issue over return of money, the victim's parents are not expected to use their kids.\n7. The Trial Court has discussed all the relevant aspects and the impugned order based upon fair appraisal of the evidence deserves no intervention. Sentence order is based upon fair reasoning and warrants no interference except that default sentence for non-payment of the fine shall be Simple Imprisonment for two months instead of nine months and fifteen days in all.
