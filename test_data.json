This revision petition is arising out of the concurrent findings of the Courts below wherein the Trial Court recorded the conviction of the petitioner under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of Indian Penal Code (for short 'IPC'). In the appeal, the Appellate Court allowed the appeal partly and set aside the judgment of conviction in respect of the provision under Section 504 of IPC and confirmed the sentences of the remaining provisions. Being aggrieved by the same, the petitioner herein has preferred this revision petition. 2. The rank of the parties in the Trial Court will be considered henceforth for convenience. Brief facts of the case are as under: 3. It is the case of the prosecution that, on 12.12.2011 at about 11.00 a.m., at Machihalli Koracharahatti village, Government Anganavadi school, when the complainant was discharging her duties as a Anganavadi Teacher, the accused went there and picked up quarrel with the complainant by stating that she should not have informed the marriage which he had intended to marry the minor girl, who is aged about 14 years, to the Women and Child Welfare Department, Harapanahalli. The accused abused in a filthy language and slapped her on the face and asked her to marry him and also assaulted her and pulled her saree and outraged her modesty. Further he has threatened her with dire consequences. Based on the complaint lodged by the complainant, the respondent / police have registered a case in Crime No.175/2011 for the offences punishable under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of IPC. After investigation, the respondent / police have submitted the charge sheet. 4. To prove the case of the prosecution, the prosecution examined 6 witnesses as PWs.1 to 6 and got marked 7 documents as Exs.P1 to P7. Both the Courts have concurrently held that the petitioner committed the offences stated supra and recorded the conviction. Hence this revision petition. 5. Heard Shri R.B.Deshpande, learned counsel for the petitioner and Shri Rahul Rai K, learned High Court Government Pleader for the respondent - State. 6. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that, the concurrent findings recorded by the Courts below in convicting the petitioner / accused appears to be perverse, illegal and the same is liable to be set aside. 7. It is further submitted that there are no independent witnesses to the said incident. The complainant deliberately exaggerated the incident as if the petitioner has outraged her modesty and narrated in her complaint which is beyond truth. It is further submitted that the prosecution has not produced any document to show that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl. In the absence of the said document, it is not appropriate to arrive at a conclusion that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl / victim and the same was informed to the Women and Child Welfare Department. The said aspect should have been considered by the Courts below before recording the conviction. 8. It is further submitted that the Trial Court convicted the petitioner on the basis of the surmises and conjectures which are alien to the criminal jurisprudence. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Courts below are required to be set aside. Making such submission, learned counsel for the petitioner prays to allow the petition. 9. Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader (for short 'HCGP) for the respondent-State vehemently justified the concurrent findings and submitted that the name of the victim with whom the marriage of the accused was proposed to be carried out, was studying at Kasturba Residential School and the said proposed marriage was informed to the complainant. After receiving the said information, the complainant has informed the same to the Women and Child Welfare Department. Due to the said enmity, the petitioner has committed the offences as stated supra. Both the Courts have concurrently held that the petitioner has committed the offences and therefore, interference with the said findings may not be appropriate and not required. Making such submission, learned HCGP prays to dismiss the petition. 10. Having heard the submissions of learned counsels for the respective parties and also perused the findings of the Courts below in recording the conviction, it is the case of the prosecution that the marriage between the petitioner and the minor girl was fixed and it was brought to the notice of PW.1 by the villagers. The complainant has informed the said fact to the higher authority. The petitioner after having learnt that PW.1 has informed the same to the higher officials, he has gone to the office of PW.1 and started abusing, assaulting and insulting PW.1 in one or other pretext and said to have committed the offences as stated supra. 11. Having regard to the scope and ambit of the Revisional jurisdiction in interfering with the findings of the Courts below, it is appropriate to have a cursory look upon the evidence of all the witnesses, to ascertain as to whether any error committed by the Courts below in appreciating both oral and documentary evidence on record. 12. PW.1 being a Teacher who was working at Machihalli Anganvadi. On 12.12.2011, when she was working at the Anganvadi, she has learnt that the marriage of the minor girl was fixed with the petitioner and she had informed the same to the higher officials who visited the house of the victim / minor girl. Being enraged of the visit of the higher officials to the house of the minor girl, the petitioner went to Anganvadi Centre and questioned her as to why she has stopped the marriage and said to have pulled her saree, assaulted her in front of others. By that time, CW.4 intervened and pacified the matter. Thereafter, PW.1 went to the police station and lodged a complaint against the petitioner. She was cross-examined at length and she has admitted that she had not gone to the marriage negotiations proposed to be held between the petitioner and the minor girl. In spite of lengthy cross-examination being subjected to PW.1, PW.1 withstood the same and supported the case of the prosecution. 13. PW.2 - an independent witness, supported the case of the prosecution and narrated the incident as how the petitioner had assaulted PW.1 and the manner in which he has outraged her modesty. When a specific question was put to her that she is a relative of PW.1, she has admitted the relationship. However, she has assertively stated that the incident had taken place in her presence and she has seen the assault having been made by the petitioner. 14. PW.3 - witness to spot panchanama, which is marked as Ex.P2 and he has supported the case of the prosecution. 15. PW.4 also witness to Ex.P2 and supported the case of the prosecution. 16. PW.5 - Doctor who treated PW.1, issued wound certificate as per Ex.P5. As per the said wound certificate, PW.1 sustained three injuries. Though several suggestions are made about the methods and possibilities of sustaining the injuries, he has supported the case of the prosecution. 17. PW.6 was working as PSI, stated to have received the complaint on 12.12.2011 and conducted the investigation and submitted the charge sheet. 18. As per the averments of the complaint and also the evidence of PWs.1 and 2, the incident said to have taken place on 12.12.2011, on the same day, a complaint came to be registered by the complainant. The FIR was sent to the Jurisdictional Magistrate on the same date at 05.20 p.m. The evidence of PWs.1 and 2 are clinching and reliable. These two witnesses have been subjected to lengthy cross-examination; however, nothing has been elicited to disbelieve their version. In addition to their evidence, the evidence of the Doctor - PW.5 who treated PW.1 and issued wound certificate as per Ex.P5 which clearly indicates that PW.1 sustained injuries. The incident had taken place when she was discharging her official duty as Anganvadi Teacher. 19. The prosecution even though examined PWs.1 and 2 as witnesses to the incident, no independent witnesses have neither been cited nor examined as witnesses to the incident. As per the case of the prosecution, the alleged incident said to have taken place in the village, if such incident had taken place in the Anganvadi, certainly many people would have gathered, either to witness the incident or to pacify the same. Not citing the independent witnesses in such incident by the Investigating Officer, which appears to be strange and unbelievable. 20. The motive for the said incident is that PW.1 has informed to the higher officials regarding the proposed marriage of the petitioner with a minor girl. The prosecution has failed to produce any document to show that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl and further the prosecution failed to cite the officials of the Department of Women and Child Welfare to substantiate the case. When the prosecution has failed to establish the motive for commission of such offence, the commission of offence appears to be doubtful and it may be said that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt and therefore, the petitioner is entitled for acquittal in this case. However, the Courts below have failed to take note of these aspects and recorded the conviction which appears to be erroneous and not proper. Therefore, the conviction has to be set aside. 21. In the light of the above observations, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER (i) The Criminal Revision Petition is allowed. (ii) The judgment and order dated 11.07.2013 passed in CC.No.378/2012 by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Harapanahalli and the judgment and order dated 21.07.2017 passed in Cml.A.No.78/2013 by the I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Davanagere are set aside. (iii) The petitioner is acquitted for the offences punishable under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of IPC. (iv) Bail bonds executed, if any, stand cancelled. Sd/- JUDGE BSS List No.: 1 Sl No.: 49",

The petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime No.1336 of 2017 of Mulanthuruthy police station, registered alleging offence punishable under Sections 450, 376(2),(i),(n), 506 IPC and Section 3(d) r/w Sec. 4,5(1),(m),(n), r/w Sec.6 of POCSO Act, 2012. 3. The victim in the instant case is a minor girl aged 13 years. Her mother is no more and her father has remarried and is living elsewhere. She is now admitted in the Don Bosco Snehabhavan at Ernakulam. It appears that when she appeared moody and showed behavioral problems, a Counselor interacted with her. The disclosure she made is heart rending. The Counselor informed the child line authorities who in turn intimated the police. It is in the above fact scenario that the crime was registered. 4.According to the victim child, who is now studying in the 8th standard, the petitioner is a near relative and she calls him 'valiachan'. According to her, when she was in the 2nd standard, the petitioner started sexually assaulting her. He used to touch her private parts and used to perform oral sex on her. She was made to touch his genitals as well. On various occasions thereafter, the petitioner repeated the same acts. As she had no one to disclose the sexual abuse that she was being subjected to and as she was confused, she did not reveal this fact to anyone. In the month of September, 2017, the petitioner repeated the same acts. This tormented her and she became moody and restless which fact was noticed by the Counselor. Pursuant to the registration of the crime, the petitioner was arrested on 28.10.2017 and has been in custody since then. 5.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is a 52 year old man and is undergoing treatment for cardiac ailments at the Kottayam Medical College Hospital for the past six months. It is submitted that there are serious inconsistencies in the statement given by the victim child. There was no way that the petitioner could have sexually assaulted the minor child is the submission. 6.The learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer and has made available the case diary for perusal. 7.I have gone through the same and It tells a very sad story. The victim child is a destitute with no one to look after and has been housed in various institutions since a very young age. The petitioner, by abusing his status as a near relative, has sexually assaulted the child. The investigation is still in the early stages and I find no reason to release the petitioner on bail.

Appeal No. 67/17 FIR No. 351/16 Police Station : Lajpat Nagar Under Section : 302/34 IPC 'S '(CCL), S/o Shri 'G' (Appellant being minor is represented through natural guardian/father, Sh. 'G') ........Appellant.\nVersus\nState/ Govt of NCT .......Non­appellant/respondent\nO R D E R 1. Vide this order I shall decide the appeal filed on behalf of the appellant/CCL 'S' through his father against the order dated 13.01.2017 passed by the Ld. Juvenile Justice Board­II Delhi wherein the Ld. JJB has directed that medical opinion with regard to the age of the CCL/appellant be obtained by a duly constituted medical board at Safdarjung Hospital. 2. The appellant/CCL was apprehended by the police during the investigation of FIR No. 351/16, PS Lajpat Nagar which was initially registered U/s 307/34 IPC but subsequently due to death of the victim, Section 302 IPC was also added in the said case. 3. The appellant/CCL claimed juvenility and consequently age determination inquiry was conducted by the Ld. JJB­II. During the course of said inquiry it has come on record that after his apprehension the appellant/CCL had furnished his school documents in the nature of Scholar's register and transfer certificate Form purportedly issued from Chaudhary Beerpal Singh Inter College, Barah Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh. However the said document was found to be forged upon verification and subsequently yet another school record in the nature of school leaving certificate purportedly issued by Principal, Dhani Ram Sharma Public School, Makanpur Khadar, Post Dankaur District, Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh was filed alongwith bail application of appellant/CCL. In the age determination inquiry, the Ld. Board has examined CW­1, Principal of the said school and CW­2, Shri Harjit Panwar, Head Clerk, Transport Authority, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi. The Ld. JJB also examined the appellant/CCL under section 165 Evidence Act wherein the CCL claimed that he had taken admission in Chaudhary Beerpal Singh Inter College, Barah Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh but he did not attend any classes. He was also examined in order to ascertain the documents on the basis of which he had set up his date of birth of 08.09.1992 before the Transport Authority at Delhi for procuring his driving licence but the Ld. Counsel for the CCL has contended that the said driving licence was procured through a tout/middle man. The Juvenile Justice Board placed reliance on the judgments titled, 'Om Prakash Vs. State of Rajasthan & Anr.','Parag Bhati Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.' and other judgment titled 'Mukarrab Vs. State of UP' to hold that the plea of minority set up by the CCL is not free from ambiguity and doubts. The JJB directed for obtaining the medical opinion based on scientific investigations as regards age of CCL. 4. The Ld. counsel for appellant has vehemently argued that once the Juvenile Justice Board had examined CW­1, Principal of Dhani Ram Sharma Public School, Uttar Pradesh then there was no occasion for the JJB to order for constitution of medical board for seeking medical opinion in respect of the age of the appellant. 5. The Hon'ble Apex Court in 'Om Prakash vs. State of Rajasthan (Supra)' has decided about the approach to be adopted in age enquiry in grave and heinous offences and held that if there is a clear and unambiguous case in favour of the juvenile accused that he was a minor below the age of 18 years on the date of the incident, he would be entitled for this special protection under the Juvenile Justice Act. But when an accused commits a grave and heinous offence and attempts to take statutory shelter under the guise of being a minor, a casual or cavalier approach, cannot be permitted as the courts are enjoined upon to perform their duties with the object of protecting the confidence of common man in the institution entrusted with the administration of justice. 6. Thus in a circumstance where the Ld JJB cannot arrive at a conclusive finding regarding the age of the accused, the opinion of the medical experts based on x­ray and ossification test can be obtained. 7. The benefit of the principle of benevolent legislation attached to Juvenile Justice Act would thus apply to only such cases wherein the accused is held to be a juvenile based on cogent evidence regarding his minority. 8. In view of the above discussions, the impugned order of the Ld. JJB for obtaining the medical opinion can not be faulted by appellant/CCL who gives forged and fabricated school documents regarding his age initially and also uses documents showing his majority for obtaining Driving Licence from Transport authority/Govt Dept but hides the said documents when involved in case of heinous nature.",
    "Question": "In light of the case described in the passage, what implications do the forged documents have on the juvenile's plea and what role does the law play in determining the validity of such claims, especially considering the nature of offenses involved?",
    "A": "Forged documents strengthen the juvenile's plea regardless of evidence.",
    "B": "The law mandates thorough scrutiny of claims to protect against misuse of juvenile provisions.",
    "C": "Legally, age claims can be accepted without evidence if the individual claims to be minor.",

    "Reasoning": "The passage emphasizes the importance of verifying the authenticity of documents provided to back the juvenile's claim, especially in serious cases.

BEFORE THE HON'BLE MR JUSTICE HEMANT CHANDANGOUDAR CRIMINAL PETITION NO. 5806 OF 2024. The petitioners-accused, who have been charge-sheeted for offences punishable under Sections 363 and 366 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), as well as Sections 3(a), 4, 5(j)(ii), 5(L), and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, are before this Court seeking relief. The prosecution alleges that the petitioners-accused, fully aware that the daughter of petitioner No.2 (accused No.2) was a minor at the time of the incident, solemnized her marriage with accused No.1, and thereafter, accused No.1 committed forcible sexual intercourse with her. As a result of this wedlock, a girl child was born. The petitioners-accused and the survivor are present before this Court and have filed a joint affidavit stating that the marriage of the daughter of accused No.2--alleged to be a minor--was solemnized with accused No.1 due to inadvertence and ignorance of the law. The affidavit further states that from the said wedlock, a girl child was born who is approximately six months old as of today, and that if the petitioners-accused are subjected to trial, it would result in their incarceration, thereby causing additional agony and misery. It is also stated that the survivor and her child are solely dependent on the petitioners-accused for their daily needs. Although the offences are cognizable and non-compoundable, considering that the survivor is approximately 19 years and 4 months old as of today and that a baby girl was born from the wedlock between accused No.1 and the survivor, subjecting the petitioners-accused to trial would result in their incarceration, thereby causing further misery and agony to the survivor and the child rather than serving the ends of justice. Moreover, the petitioners-accused are illiterate, and the marriage was performed due to ignorance of the law. Under these circumstances, the continuation of criminal proceedings would constitute an abuse of the process of law. Accordingly, the petition is allowed.",

By this application under Section 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the Applicant seeks suspension of substantive sentence imposed by judgment dated 04/03/2021 passed by learned District Judge-2 and Additional Sessions Judge, Thane in Special (POCSO) Case No.194 of 2018 and enlargement on bail. The Applicant was charged for offences under Sections 323, 354, 376, 377 and Section 506 of the IPC and Sections 4 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. By the impugned judgment, the learned Judge has held the Applicant guilty of offences punishable under Sections 323, 354 and 376 of the IPC r/w. Section 4 of the POCSO Act. He has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years under Section 376 of the IPC and one year under Section 354 of the IPC and six months under Section 323 of the IPC. No separate sentence is imposed under Section 4 of POCSO Act. Charge against the Applicant is that he had committed rape / penetrative sexual assault on a minor girl aged about 8 years of age. The evidence of the victim prima facie indicates that the Applicant was involved in commission of the said crime. The medical evidence also suggests that there was evidence of penetrative vaginal intercourse. Thus, the material on record indicates that the Applicant, who is over 50 years of age has sexually abused the child who was barely 8 years of age as on the date of incident. The offence is not only grave but heinous in nature. There is prima facie material to believe that the Applicant was involved in commission of the crime. Considering the nature of accusations, gravity of offence and severity of punishment, in my considered view this is not a fit case for suspension of sentence and hence, the application is dismissed.",

FIR (POCSO) 10/2017 pending on the file of Additional Sessions Judge, Raichur, which is registered for the offences punishable under Sections 376, 109, 504, 307, 506 r/w Section 34 of IPC and also for the offences punishable under Sections 4 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. This petition is coming on for Orders this day, the Court made the following:- ORDER This petition is filed by the petitioners/accused Nos.2 and 3 under Section 439 of Cr.P.C., seeking regular bail in Crime No.22/2017 of Manvi Police Station, registered for the offences punishable under Sections 376, 109, 504, 307, 506 r/w Section 34 of IPC and also for the offences punishable under Sections 4 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 ('the Act' for short). Brief facts leading to filing of the complaint are that the victim has been brought up in the house of the complainant. Accused No.1/child-in-conflict with law used to visit the house of his sister. In that light, on 24.01.2017 at about 9.00 p.m., the complainant received information by the people of that area to the effect that accused No.1/child-in-conflict with law has outraged the modesty of the victim and she was screaming and immediately, she went to the house of Huligemma and through window she saw the child-in-conflict with law was undressed and was outraging the modesty of the victim. Despite shouting, he did not open the door and finally, he outraged the modesty of the victim and returned to home. Next day, when her husband came to home, the complainant narrated the incident to him and her husband called the petitioners over the phone and asked them to come over to the village to discuss about the incident. On 25.01.2017 at about 11.00 p.m., when the complainant was in the house, the accused persons came there by holding deadly weapons and started abusing her by saying that they wanted to grab the land belonging to the victim as such, they have got committed the said offence through accused No.1. They have assaulted on the head of the complainant with stick and assaulted by hands. On hearing the noise, neighbors came and rescued her. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for respondent-State. The main grounds urged by Sri Avinash A. Uploankar, learned counsel appearing for Sri Shivanand Patil, learned counsel for the petitioners are that petitioners have been implicated in this case only with an intention to grab the property. The allegations made against the petitioners are that they have abetted accused No.1 to commit the said crime and they have assaulted the complainant on the next day when they went to question about the alleged incident. There are no overt-acts so far as the other offences which have been committed by accused No.1. He has also contended that the injured has been discharged from the hospital. He has further contended that petitioners have got both movable and immovable properties, therefore, there is no chance of they being absconded. He has also contended that if the petitioners are released on bail, they are ready to abide by the conditions to be imposed by this Court and they are ready to offer sureties. On these grounds, he prays for allowing the petition. On the contrary, learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for the respondent-State has vehemently contended that petitioners have abetted accused No.1 to commit serious offence of sexual assault against the victim. He has also contended that at this juncture, if the petitioners are released on bail, they may tamper with the prosecution witnesses, they may abscond and they may not be available for trial. On these grounds, he prays for dismissal of the petition. I have gone through the contents of the complaint and other material produced along with the petition. On going through the contents of the complaint, it would indicate that at the first instance the alleged incident has taken place on 24.01.2017 by accused No.1 who is considered to be child in conflict with law. He has been released on bail by the Juvenile Justice Board. The allegation made against the petitioners is that when they had been to the house of the complainant on 25.01.2017 at about 11.00 p.m., they have abused and assaulted the complainant with stick, hands and thereby, caused injuries. When the injured has been discharged from the hospital and when there are no serious allegations against the petitioners except the allegation of abetment, I feel that if the petitioners are released on bail by imposing stringent conditions, it would safeguard the interest of the prosecution and it would meet the ends of justice. For the aforementioned reasons, the petition is allowed and petitioners/accused Nos.2 and 3 are ordered to be released on bail, subject to the following conditions: i) The petitioners shall execute personal bonds for a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs Only) each with two solvent sureties each for the likesum to the satisfaction of the jurisdictional Court; ii) The petitioners shall not indulge in hampering the investigation or tampering the prosecution witnesses; iii) The petitioners shall make themselves available to the Investigating Officer as and when required; iv) The petitioners shall appear before the Trial Court regularly on all the dates of hearing without fail. v) The petitioners shall not leave the jurisdiction of the concerned Court without its prior permission.",

The revision is directed against the order of Addl. Sessions Judge/Special Judge POCSO Act, Lucknow dated 22.07.2019. Learned A.G.A. termed the order impugned in this revision as an interlocutory order and argued against the admissibility under sub Section (2) of Section 397 Cr.P.C. The court noted whether the impugned order was passed misconstruing the provisions of Section 38 of the POCSO Act. The victim was a 5-year-old girl who was sexually abused at her school. The order allowing the victim to have an interpreter was challenged by the accused's counsel, claiming that the provision applies only to children with disabilities. The court elaborated on the necessity of providing an interpreter based on the age and ability of the child to communicate. Section 38 allows the court discretion in appointing an interpreter while asserting that being 'unable to communicate' differs from being 'disabled'. The court highlighted that the spirit of Section 38(1) aligns with the provisions of the Evidence Act, emphasizing the importance of ensuring the child can effectively communicate during judicial proceedings.

    "Correct Answer": "The court emphasizes that the term 'unable to communicate' can apply to children who are not physically disabled if their ability to effectively express their testimony is compromised.",
    "Reasoning": "The court explained that children, especially younger ones, may struggle to communicate due to various reasons including lack of vocabulary and cognitive maturity.

The survivor is a 15 year old child. The applicant herein is the husband of her aunt. According to the survivor child, the applicant had subjected her to sexual abuse while she was in the VIII standard. She went on to state that in the month of July, 2016, the applicant subjected her to penetrative sexual abuse. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that the applicant had accommodated the survivor and her sister when her mother had gone to Singapore for work. He had maintained the children for years and it was only in the month of March, 2018 that the children had left his house and had joined their grand mother. In the initial statement given to the Police, there was no allegation that he had subjected the child to penetrative sexual intercourse. It was contended by the learned counsel that the applicant is innocent and he was roped in without a just cause. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the allegations are grave. The child did not disclose the entire facts initially as the wife of the applicant was also with her. In her 164 statement before the learned Magistrate, the child had stated in detail the gross sexual abuse that she was subjected to by the applicant herein. I have considered the submissions advanced by both sides and have gone through the 164 statement. Prima facie, it appears that there are convincing materials which point to the involvement of the applicant. In that view of the matter, this Court will not be justified in granting an order of pre-arrest bail to the applicant. I direct the applicant to surrender before the Investigating Officer or the court having jurisdiction and seek regular bail.

The relevant and necessary facts for the adjudication of the present appeal are that from the wedlock of the parties a girl child was born in the year 2007 and she is presently a little over 11 years of age.

The Learned Family Court vide order dated 13.07.2018 directed the appellant (mother) herein to remain present with the minor child on 18.07.2018.

The Counsellor submitted his report, after interacting with the child, in the presence of two female Sub-Inspectors. In his report, he brought out that the child did not complain of any bad behavior towards her by the father and in fact expressed a desire to stay with the father only. He also reported that the child was confident and was speaking without fear. On 19.07.2018, the child was produced in the court from Nirmal Chhaya, where she was sent, keeping her best interest in mind, for one night on 18.07.2018.

The attention is also drawn towards the observation made by the Bench which is as follows: \n\n\"In view of the categorical statement made by the corpus before this Court that she is an adult, even as per the record she is an adult and even by appearance and the manner in which she has faced the Court, this Court has got no doubt that she is an adult and is well aware of her rights, a case for grant of indulgence has been made out.\" \n\nCiting the above piece of evidence, learned counsel for the applicant has argued that I.O. has over-looked all these aspects and has submitted charge-sheet in the present case in routine manner which is nothing but abuse of process of law and the same needs to be quashed. \n\nLearned A.G.A. has vehemently opposed the prayer of quashing and has drawn attention towards the statement of informant which is annexed at page no. 26 of the paper book in which he has stated that his daughter had studied up to class-V and that he was providing Transfer Certificate. He has stated the age of the victim to be 16 years, therefore in view of the above, it is argued that the age of the victim is required to be determined in accordance with the provision of Section 94 of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 as has been held in Crl. Misc. Writ Petition No. 20816 of 2016, Nisha Naaz alias Anuradha and Another Vs. State of U.P. & 2 others decided on 6.02.2019 in which decision of Suhani Vs. State of U.P., 2018 SCC Online SC 781 has been distinguished and the finding of Hon'ble Apex Court in Jarnail Singh Vs. State of Haryana (2013) 7 SCC 263 has been followed which provides that victim's age shall also be decided following the same provision as are followed for determining the age of a juvenile which provides as follows:-\n\n\"94. Presumption and determination of age- (1)Where, it is obvious to the Committee or the Board, based on the appearance of the person brought before it under any of the provisions of this Act (other than for the purpose of giving evidence) that the said person is a child, the Committee or the Board shall record such observation stating the age of the child as nearly as may be and proceed with the inquiry under section 14 or section 36, as the case may be, without waiting for further confirmation of the age. \n\n2.In case, the Committee or the Board has reasonable grounds for doubt regarding whether the person brought before it is a child or not, the Committee or the Board, as the case may be, shall undertake the process of age determination, by seeking evidence by obtaining ? \n\ni.the date of birth certificate from the school, or the matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned examination Board, if available; and in the absence thereof; \n\nii.the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat; \n\niii.and only in the absence of (i) and (ii) above, age shall be determined by an ossification test or any other latest medical age determination test conducted on the orders of the Committee or the Board: \n\nProvided such age determination test conducted on the order of the Committee or the Board shall be completed within fifteen days from the date of such order. \n\n3. The age recorded by the Committee or the Board to be the age of person so brought before it shall, for the purpose of this Act, be deemed to be the true age of that person.\" \n\nIt would be further pertinent to mention here the judgment of Apex Court rendered in Independent Thought vs. Union of India and another, (2017) 10 SCC 800, paragraph nos. 1 and 107 of which are as under:\n\n\"1.The issue before us is a limited but one of considerable public importance ? whether sexual intercourse between a man and his wife being a girl between 15 and 18 years of age is rape? Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) answers this in the negative, but in our opinion sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 years of age is rape regardless of whether she is married or not. The Exception carved out in IPC creates an unnecessary and artificial distinction between a married girl child and an unmarried girl child and has no rational nexus with any unclear objective sought to be achieved. The artificial distinction is arbitrary and discriminatory and is definitely not in the best interest of the girl child. The artificial distinction is contrary to the philosophy and ethos of Article 15(3) of the Constitution as well as contrary to Article 21 of the Constitution and our commitments in international conventions. It is also contrary to the philosophy behind some statutes, the bodily integrity of the girl child and her reproductive choice. What is equally dreadful, the artificial distinction turns a blind eye to trafficking of the girl child and surely each one of us must discourage trafficking which is such a horrible social evil.\" \n\n\"107. On a complete assessment of the law and the documentary material, it appears that there are really five options before us: (i) To let the incongruity remain as it is ? this does not seem a viable option to us, given that the lives of thousands of young girls are at stake; (ii) To strike down as unconstitutional Exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC ? in the present case W.P. (C) No. 382 of 2013 Page 68 this is also not a viable option since this relief was given up and no such issue was raised; (iii) To reduce the age of consent from 18 years to 15 years ? this too is not a viable option and would ultimately be for Parliament to decide; (iv) To bring the POCSO Act in consonance with Exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC ? this is also not a viable option since it would require not only a retrograde amendment to the POCSO Act but also to several other pro-child statutes; (v) To read Exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC in a purposive manner to make it in consonance with the POCSO Act, the spirit of other pro-child legislations and the human rights of a married girl child. Being purposive and harmonious constructionists, we are of opinion that this is the only pragmatic option available. Therefore, we are left with absolutely no other option but to harmonize the system of laws relating to children and require Exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC to now be meaningfully read as: \"Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape.\" It is only through this reading that the intent of social justice to the married girl child and the constitutional vision of the framers of our Constitution can be preserved and protected and perhaps given impetus.\" \n\nI have gone through the F.I.R. \n\nIn F.I.R., it is mentioned by O.P. No.2 that on 26.10.2018 in the after-noon at 12:00 noon, his daughter aged about 16 years was enticed away by the applicant in absence of O.P. No.2 and his wife. He entreated before the family members of the accused applicant to return his daughter but she was not returned. He was threatened and abused also. The police after lodging the F.I.R. investigated the case after recording the statement of as many as five witnesses has submitted charge-sheet which includes the statement of informant as well as his wife. The statement given by the witnesses cannot be disbelieved in proceeding under Section 482 Cr.P.C. \n\nTime and again it has been highlighted by Supreme Court that at the stage of charge sheet factual query and assessment of defence evidence is beyond purview of scrutiny under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The allegations being factual in nature can be decided only subject to evidence. In view of settled legal proposition, no findings can be recorded about veracity of allegations at this juncture in absence of evidence. Apex Court has highlighted that jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. be sparingly/rarely invoked with complete circumspection and caution. Very recently in Criminal Appeal No.675 of 2019 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Crl.) No.1151 of 2018) (Md. Allauddin Khan Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) decided on 15th April, 2019, Supreme Court observed as to what should be examined by High Court in an application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and in paras 15, 16 and 17 said as under:\n\n\"15. The High Court should have seen that when a specific grievance of the appellant in his complaint was that respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have committed the offences punishable under Sections 323, 379 read with Section 34 IPC, then the question to be examined is as to whether there are allegations of commission of these two offences in the complaint or not. In other words, in order to see whether any prima facie case against the accused for taking its cognizable is made out or not, the Court is only required to see the allegations made in the complaint. In the absence of any finding recorded by the High Court on this material question, the impugned order is legally unsustainable. \n\n16. The second error is that the High Court in para 6 held that there are contradictions in the statements of the witnesses on the point of occurrence. \n\n17. In our view, the High Court had no jurisdiction to appreciate the evidence of the proceedings under Section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short \"Cr.P.C.\") because whether there are contradictions or/and inconsistencies in the statements of the witnesses is essentially an issue relating to appreciation of evidence and the same can be gone into by the Judicial Magistrate during trial when the entire evidence is adduced by the parties. That stage is yet to come in this case.\"                          (Emphasis added)\n \nFrom the perusal of material on record and looking into the facts of this case, at this stage, it cannot be said that no cognizable offence is made out against the applicant. All the submissions made at the Bar relates to the disputed questions of fact, which cannot be adjudicated upon by this Court in proceedings u/s 482 Cr.P.C. At this stage only prima facie case is to be seen in the light of law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in cases of R. P. Kapur vs. The State Of Punjab, AIR 1960 SC 866, State of Haryana and others Vs. Ch. Bhajan Lal and others, AIR 1992 SC 604, State of Bihar and Anr. Vs. P.P. Sharma, AIR 1991 SC 1260 lastly Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. and Ors. Vs. Md. Sharaful Haque and Ors., AIR 2005 SC 9. The disputed defense of the accused cannot be considered at this stage.\n\nThe prayer for quashing the proceedings is refused. \n\nSince it has been apprised by learned counsel for the applicant that accused applicant is already on bail, the applicant may approach the trial court to seek discharge at appropriate stage, if so advised, and before the said forum, he may raise all the pleas which have been taken by him here.\n\nWith this direction, this Application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is disposed of.\n\nOrder Date :- 26.9.2019",

    "B": "The Investigating Officer's credibility is not considered, and the charges can be quashed without review if the victim denies the allegations.",
    "C": "The Investigating Officer's analysis is critical; any failure to adhere to procedure or consider vital evidence can indicate bias.",

The discussion included the petitioner and the complainant's daughter being in a relationship and that they intended to marry. The complainant and victim expressed that they do not wish to pursue the case following the marriage on 18/03/2021, supported by evidence. The prosecution opposed this based on the serious nature of the offense involving the victim's age (16 years). Nonetheless, the court determined that continuing the case would be an abuse of legal process and quashed the FIR.",

The case of the prosecution is that, the petitioner - accused fully knowing that the survivor was the minor, solemnized his marriage with her and committed penetrative sexual assault. The survivor and her parents were present before this Court on 20.12.2023, and filed a joint affidavit stating that the marriage of the survivor with the petitioner was solemnized inadvertently, and in ignorance of law, and from the said wedlock, a male child was born. They further stated that the survivor and the newly born child are dependent on the petitioner for their livelihood. If the criminal proceedings are allowed to continue, it would result in incarceration of the petitioner which would cause more misery and agony to the survivor and her child rather than securing the ends of justice. The petitioner and the survivor represented by her natural guardian have filed a joint affidavit that the sexual intercourse and the solemnization of their marriage was a consensual one. They would register their marriage upon the survivor attaining the age of majority. The object of POCSO Act is to protect minors from sexual abuse and not to criminalize the consensual relationship between adolescents who had consensual sexual intercourse without knowing the consequences. Though having sexual intercourse consensually with the minor is an offence under the POCSO Act, it would be appropriate to quash the impugned proceedings, otherwise, it would result in miscarriage of justice to the survivor and the child.

THE SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE,\n     FAROKE POLICE STATION, KOZHIKODE DISTRICT - 673 001.\n       R BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI.AMJAD ALI\n    THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 13-06-2018,\nTHE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n1.This application is filed under Section 439 of the Code of\n  Criminal Procedure.\n2.The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No.133 of 2018\n  of Faroke Police Station, registered under Sections 306 and\n  376 of the IPC and Section 3 r/w Sec. 4, 9(m) r/w Sec. 10\n  and 11(v) r/w Sec. 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual\n  Offences Act, 2012.\n3.According to the prosecution, the applicant herein is a near\n  relative of the victim girl who was just 15 years of age.\n  They became close to each other and by misusing the\n  relationship, started having a sexual relationship.     He also\n  used to take photographs and videos of their intimate acts.\n  Later, their relationship became strained when the applicant\n  started to have a liking towards another girl. It is alleged\n  that   when   the    victim questioned   the applicant,   he\n  threatened her with the photographs and videos which were\n  in his possession.    This tormented the minor girl and she\n  decided to take her own life.        Initially, the Crime was\n  registered on 23.3.2018 under Section 174 of the Cr.P.C.\n  Later, on the basis of an additional statement given by the\n  brother of the victim, the offences under the       POCSO Act\n  and other grave offences under the IPC were incorporated.\n4.The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submits that\n  a detailed statement of the brother of the victim as well as\n  all the near relatives were recorded immediately after the\n  registration of the Crime. No one had a case that the\n  applicant herein had anything to do with the minor girl. It\n  was much later, i.e., on 3.4.2018, the allegation of sexual\n  abuse and other grave acts were raised by the brother. The\ndrastical turnaround would affect the credibility of his version\n  is the submission. Finally, it is submitted that the applicant\n  was arrested on 05.04.2018 and having regard to the period\n  of incarceration undergone and the stage of investigation,\n  he be released.\n5.The learned Public Prosecutor while opposing the prayer\n  submitted that the allegations are extremely grave. The\n applicant herein is a near relative of the victim girl and there\n is no reason to believe the version of the brother of the\n victim. It is submitted that the applicant by feigning love\n have sexually abused the minor child.\n6. I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone\n  through the materials and records. Though the allegations\n  are grave, the fact remains that the investigation has made\n  much headway and has reached the final stages. As\n  submitted by the learned counsel, the brother of the victim\n  did not state before the investigating officer while furnishing\n  his initial statement that on the day prior to the death of the\n  child, he had an occasion to interact with her and that she\n  had divulged about the horrendous acts committed by the\n  applicant.\n7.Having regard to the nature and gravity of the allegations,\n  the material in support thereof, the stage of investigation\n  and the period of incarceration undergone, I am of the view\n  that the applicant can now be enlarged on bail.\n8.In the result, this application will stand allowed. The\n  applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond\n  for Rs.1,00,000/-(Rupees One lakh only) with two solvent\n  sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court\n  having jurisdiction. The above order shall be subject to the\n  following conditions:\n            1). The applicant shall appear before the\n            Investigating Officer on all Saturdays between\n            9 a.m. and 10 a.m., for 2 months or till final\n            report is filed, whichever is earlier.\n            2). The applicant shall not intimidate or attempt\n            to influence the witnesses; nor shall he tamper\n            with the evidence.\n            3). The applicant shall not commit any offence\n            while he is on bail.\n            4). The applicant shall not leave India without\n            the permission of the Court and if having\n            passport, shall deposit the same before the Trial\n            Court within a week; If release of the passport\n            is required at a later period, the applicant shall\n            be at liberty to move appropriate application\n            before the Court having jurisdiction.\n  In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the\n  jurisdictional Court shall be empowered to consider the\n  application for cancellation, if any, and pass appropriate\n  orders in accordance with the law.",

This petition seeking an order of pre-arrest bail is preferred\nby the accused in Crime No.42 of 2018 of the Hosdurg\nPolice Station, registered under Sections 366 and 377 of\nthe Indian Penal Code and under Sections 5(I), (m) and 6\nof the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,\n2012 (for short 'POCSO').\n2. The aforesaid crime was registered on the basis of\ninformation furnished by a minor girl who was studying in\nthe IV Standard. She used to travel to the School in the\nautorickshaw of the petitioner herein. The child in her\nstatement has stated in clear and unambiguous terms that\nwhile she was in the III and IV standard, the petitioner\nused to sexually assault her on multiple occasions. It is\nfurther alleged that on 11.1.2018, the victim was taken to\nthe residential home of the petitioner herein and after\nremoving her clothes, she was subjected to gross sexual\nabuse.\n3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted\nthat the allegations are without basis. According to the\nlearned counsel, even if the allegations are admitted as\nsuch, offence under Section 5 r/w. Section 6 of the Act will\nnot be made out. It is further alleged that other crimes\nhave also been registered at the instance of the minor child\nwhich would render her case against the petitioner suspect.\n4. The learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer. It is\nsubmitted that the medical examination report of the victim\nreveal that she was subjected to sexual abuse.\n5. I have considered the submissions advanced.\n6. Having regard to facts and circumstances, the contention of\nthe learned counsel that the petitioner is totally innocent\ncannot be countenanced. The medical certificate of the\ninjured sufficiently corroborates the case of the\nprosecution. In that view of the matter, it does not appear\nto me that this Court will be justified in arming the\npetitioner with an order of pre-arrest bail.\n7. However, the learned counsel prays that a direction be\nissued to enable the petitioner to surrender before the\njurisdictional court. I do not see any need for issuance of\nany such directions. The petitioner shall surrender as\nexpeditiously as possible and if an application for bail is\nfiled, the same shall be considered and orders shall be\npassed on its merits.\nThis petition will stand dismissed.\nSd/-\nRaja Vijayaraghavan V.,\nJudge",

DVC.No.11 of 2021 has been presented by the respondents as against the civil revision petitioner. There is no dispute in the relationship between the parties. The petitioner married the first respondent on 06.02.2014 at Chengalpet. From the wedlock, the second respondent was born on 04.09.2016. The first respondent alleged that the petitioner never used to lend an ear to the troubles that the first respondent was facing or gave her any financial solace during the time they were living together. She would plead that the civil revision petitioner wanted only a boy child, but since a girl child had been born, and that too with health complications, he had forsaken/deserted the mother and child and started living separately. Therefore, she had presented the aforesaid Domestic Violence Petition. On being served with the petition, the husband moved an application invoking the provisions of Order VII Rule 11. The learned Judicial Magistrate, on perusal of the complaint, came to the conclusion that the cause of action exists and therefore, dismissed the application on 04.01.2023. On appeal, the appeal was dismissed on 23.08.2023. Aggrieved by the same, the present revision has been filed. The wife did not seek any relief under Section 18(1) of the Domestic Violence Act and therefore, she is not entitled to maintain the petition. However, it is argued that under Section 12 of the Act, an application can be filed by an aggrieved lady to claim one or more reliefs. Each relief under Sections 18 to 22 are independent and can be claimed. A reading of the complaint shows there has been verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. Hence, the complaint is maintainable.

No.15174/2023, which is first application under Section 389(1) of Cr.P.C. moved on behalf of appellant No.1 - Child IN Conflict with law seeking suspension of sentence and grant of bail.\nAppellant stands convicted under Section 450 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 05 years RI with fine of Rs.500/-, under Section 328 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 05 years RI with fine of Rs.500/- and under Section 6 of POCSO Act read with Section 376(D) of IPC and sentenced to undergo 20 years' RI with fine of Rs.50,000/- with default stipulation vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 01.08.2023 passed by the Special Judge (POCSO Act), Bhind (Madhya Pradesh) in Special Case (ST No.) No.80/2021. As per prosecution story, while parents of the prosecutrix had gone away to attend a marriage, her brother and sister were sleeping on the terrace and she was sleeping in the courtyard on the ground floor, on 11.05.2019, at about 12 in the intervening night, accused - Jitendra, Rohit and present appellant (juvenile) entered the house from terrace area and caught hold the prosecutrix. She was dragged in a room, where she was forced to consume liquor, while present appellant-(juvenile) and another accused were standing outside the room. Main accused Jitendra committed rape on the prosecutrix. Accordingly, case has been registered. Upon filing of challan, the case was committed for trial to the Sessions Court. The Sessions Court upon critical evaluation of the evidence placed on record has convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred above. Learned counsel for the appellant at the first instance fairly submits that the appellant (juvenile) has already suffered the jail incarceration for almost three years. There is no allegation of either violating the personal liberty of the prosecutrix or committing rape. Instead, the sole allegation against him is that he entered the house and was standing outside the room, where she was sexually abused by the main accused Jitendra. As such the conviction of the appellant under Section 376(D) of IPC and 5(G) and 6 of POCSO is fully unwarranted and based on surmises and conjecture. The appellant even otherwise, has no criminal antecedents. It is further submitted that co-accused Rohit has already been granted bail by this Court and the case of the present appellant is akin to his case. Hence, prays for suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent-State opposes the application supporting the order impugned with the submission that the appellant and two accused persons had entered the house of the prosecutrix with common intention of commission of rape. The active participation is well specific from the story of the prosecution and the evidence placed on record during trial. Hence, no exception can be taken in the matter of suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Upon hearing counsel for the parties, though this Court refrains from commenting upon rival contentions touching merits of the matter but looking to nature of allegation and since the appellant is having no criminal record, the application deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, we allow the application and it is directed that the jail sentence of the appellant - (juvenile) shall remain suspended and he be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court subject to verification of factum regarding deposit of fine amount. Appellant is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court on 23.11.2023 and on other subsequent dates as may be fixed in this behalf with following further conditions:- (i) the concerned jail authorities are directed that before releasing the appellant, the medical examination of the appellant be conducted through the jail doctor and if it is prima facie found that she is having any symptoms of COVID-19, then the consequential follow up action or any further test required be undertaken immediately. If not, appellant shall be released on bail in terms of the conditions imposed in this order ; (ii) violation of conditions, State is free to apply for cancellation of bail. Accordingly, I.A. No.15174/2023 stands allowed and disposed of. Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of deciding the instant I.A. and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal.",

This case revolves around issues of child protection laws, particularly involving an application for bail according to the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023. A significant concern during the proceedings is the presence of the District Child Protection Officer, Md. Basar Ali, who has expressed unwillingness to testify about the sexual abuse of children. The court has taken note of this and mandated an investigation into Ali's reasons for his avoidance, expressing dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Public Prosecutor is conducting the trial, including the exclusion of Ali as a witness and refusal for a forensic examination. Further hearings are set for 10th February, 2025.",

    "Passage": "Thoukhirkhan Jamerkhan Haji vs State Of Karnataka on 14 February, 2025. IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA, DHARWAD BENCH. DATED THIS THE 14TH DAY OF FEBRUARY, 2025 BEFORE THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE HEMANT CHANDANGOUDAR. THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED U/SEC. 482 OF CR.P.C. PLEASED TO QUASH THE ENTIRE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE PETITIONERS/ACCUSED NO.1 TO 9 IN HIREKERUR P.S CR. NO.175/2022 FOR THE ALLEGED OFFENCES U/SEC. 498A, 323, 504, 506, 109, R/W 34 OF IPC AND U/SE 3 AND 4 OF DOWRY PROHIBITION ACT. Respondent No.2 lodged the FIR, alleging that her marriage with Accused No.1 was solemnized on 23.12.2018. She claims that Accused No.1 would return home late at night, pick quarrels, abuse, and assault her. On 10.11.2021, while she was three months pregnant, Accused No.1 allegedly abused her in filthy language, kicked her, and dashed her head against the wall. Upon informing her parents, she was taken to her parental home. The petitioners have submitted a notice dated 29.11.2021, issuing to Respondent No.2, asking her to resume conjugal rights. However, the FIR was lodged on 14.09.2022, nearly ten months after the alleged incident, with no plausible explanation for the delay. The complaint appears to have been filed with a revengeful intent. In the absence of specific allegations against the petitioners, merely proceeding on the basis of general allegations would amount to an abuse of the process of law.",
    "Question": "What implications might the delay in filing the FIR regarding abuse as seen in the Thoukhirkhan Jamerkhan Haji vs State Of Karnataka case have on the potential legal remedies available to Respondent No. 2?",
    "A": "The delay strengthens the credibility of the accusations.",
    "B": "The delay could potentially undermine the case, leading to questions about the authenticity and urgency of the claims made by the victim.",
    "C": "The delay has no effect on legal proceedings or outcomes.",
    "D": "The accused should automatically be presumed guilty due to the accusations.",
    "Correct Answer": "The delay could potentially undermine the case, leading to questions about the authenticity and urgency of the claims made by the victim.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage notes the considerable time elapsed before the FIR was filed, which may contribute to doubts surrounding the allegations and affect any legal remediations for the accused and victim alike."

    "Passage": "Shareef @ Muhammed Shareef vs State Of Kerala on 8 November, 2018. The accused, Shareef, faces a case registered under IPC sections related to sexual offenses against a minor girl. The victim reported inappropriate behavior by the accused towards her when she was returning home. The legal representatives argue that the victim's father has a history of criminal behavior, suggesting that the current allegations may be baseless. The court analyzed the credibility of the victim's claims, taking into account past accusations and concluded that the allegations did not inspire confidence. Anticipatory bail was granted to the accused with conditions emphasizing the protection of the victim's interests.",
    "Question": "In the context of the passage concerning Shareef @ Muhammed Shareef's court case, how does the law address situations where the credibility of the victim is questioned due to past behaviors? What legal measures are put in place to ensure protection for victims of child abuse?",
    "A": "Victims with questionable credibility receive no protection under the law, and their claims are disregarded.",
    "B": "The law allows consideration of past behaviors but mandates protective measures for victims regardless.",
    "C": "Victims must provide irrefutable evidence to obtain any legal protection against their abusers.",
    "D": "The legal system only prioritizes the accused's rights without accounting for victim protection.",
    "Correct Answer": "The law allows consideration of past behaviors but mandates protective measures for victims regardless.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage indicates that even though the court found doubts regarding the victim's past allegations, it still imposed conditions on the accused to protect the victim, thereby showing the law prioritizes victim safety while considering the accused's rights."

THE SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE,\n     FAROKE POLICE STATION, KOZHIKODE DISTRICT - 673 001.\n       R BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI.AMJAD ALI\n    THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 13-06-2018,\nTHE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n1.This application is filed under Section 439 of the Code of\n  Criminal Procedure.\n2.The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No.133 of 2018\n  of Faroke Police Station, registered under Sections 306 and\n  376 of the IPC and Section 3 r/w Sec. 4, 9(m) r/w Sec. 10\n  and 11(v) r/w Sec. 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual\n  Offences Act, 2012.\n3.According to the prosecution, the applicant herein is a near\n  relative of the victim girl who was just 15 years of age.\n  They became close to each other and by misusing the\n  relationship, started having a sexual relationship.     He also\n  used to take photographs and videos of their intimate acts.\n  Later, their relationship became strained when the applicant\n  started to have a liking towards another girl. It is alleged\n  that   when   the    victim questioned the applicant,   he\n  threatened her with the photographs and videos which were\n  in his possession.    This tormented the minor girl and she\n  decided to take her own life.        Initially, the Crime was\n  registered on 23.3.2018 under Section 174 of the Cr.P.C.\n  Later, on the basis of an additional statement given by the\n  brother of the victim, the offences under the       POCSO Act\n  and other grave offences under the IPC were incorporated.\n4.The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submits that\n  a detailed statement of the brother of the victim as well as\n  all the near relatives were recorded immediately after the\n  registration of the Crime. No one had a case that the\n  applicant herein had anything to do with the minor girl. It\n  was much later, i.e., on 3.4.2018, the allegation of sexual\n  abuse and other grave acts were raised by the brother. The\ndrastical turnaround would affect the credibility of his version\n  is the submission. Finally, it is submitted that the applicant\n  was arrested on 05.04.2018 and having regard to the period\n  of incarceration undergone and the stage of investigation,\n  he be released.\n5.The learned Public Prosecutor while opposing the prayer\n  submitted that the allegations are extremely grave. The\n applicant herein is a near relative of the victim girl and there\n is no reason to believe the version of the brother of the\n victim. It is submitted that the applicant by feigning love\n have sexually abused the minor child.\n6. I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone\n  through the materials and records. Though the allegations\n  are grave, the fact remains that the investigation has made\n  much headway and has reached the final stages. As\n  submitted by the learned counsel, the brother of the victim\n  did not state before the investigating officer while furnishing\n  his initial statement that on the day prior to the death of the\n  child, he had an occasion to interact with her and that she\n  had divulged about the horrendous acts committed by the\n  applicant.\n7.Having regard to the nature and gravity of the allegations,\n  the material in support thereof, the stage of investigation\n  and the period of incarceration undergone, I am of the view\n  that the applicant can now be enlarged on bail.\n8.In the result, this application will stand allowed. The\n  applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond\n  for Rs.1,00,000/-(Rupees One lakh only) with two solvent\n  sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court\n  having jurisdiction. The above order shall be subject to the\n  following conditions:\n            1). The applicant shall appear before the\n            Investigating Officer on all Saturdays between\n            9 a.m. and 10 a.m., for 2 months or till final\n            report is filed, whichever is earlier.\n            2). The applicant shall not intimidate or attempt\n            to influence the witnesses; nor shall he tamper\n            with the evidence.\n            3). The applicant shall not commit any offence\n            while he is on bail.\n            4). The applicant shall not leave India without\n            the permission of the Court and if having\n            passport, shall deposit the same before the Trial\n            Court within a week; If release of the passport\n            is required at a later period, the applicant shall\n            be at liberty to move appropriate application\n            before the Court having jurisdiction.\n  In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the\n  jurisdictional Court shall be empowered to consider the\n  application for cancellation, if any, and pass appropriate\n  orders in accordance with the law.",
    "Question": "In the case outlined in the passage, what legal actions or protections are available to the victim girl, who is 15 years old and has reported being sexually abused by a near relative?

    "A": "The victim girl can report the case to the local police and expect immediate support from community leaders.",
    "B": "Under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, immediate legal action should be taken to ensure her safety and pursue prosecution against the abuser.",

    "D": "Local authorities will automatically intervene without any need for a report or formal complaint from the victim herself.",
    "Correct Answer": "Under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, immediate legal action should be taken to ensure her safety and pursue prosecution against the abuser.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage details serious allegations against the applicant who is a near relative of the victim girl, who is protected under the POCSO Act, which mandates legal intervention in cases of sexual abuse of minors."

    "B": "It strengthens the child's rights as it allows for a fair appellate process while maintaining a framework for protection.",
    "C": "It signifies that all child abusers will eventually be released on bail if they wait long enough.",
    "D": "It has no significant impact and neither enhances nor detracts from existing laws.",
    "Correct Answer": "It strengthens the child's rights as it allows for a fair appellate process while maintaining a framework for protection.",

    "A": "Child protection laws are effective regardless of individual outcomes, maintaining deterrence.",

Shahpuri, Advocate\n            for the complainant.\n                            ****\n\nH.S. MADAAN, J.\n\n            This petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C. for pre-arrest bail has\nbeen filed by the petitioner - Rakesh Kumar, an accused in FIR No.30\ndated 6.7.2018 under Section 8 of POCSO Act and 216 IPC, registered at\nWomen Police Station, Yamuna Nagar.\n\n            Briefly stated, the facts of the case, as per the prosecution\nstory, are that on 29.12.2017 when the prosecutrix aged about 16 years\nhad gone to her BARA from her house at village Dhaurang, District\nYamuna Nagar, then Rakesh son of Subhash (present petitioner) resident\nof that very village misbehaved with her catching hold of arm of\nprosecutrix. The prosecutrix narrated the entire story to her parents, then\npolice was informed by moving a written application at Women Police\nStation, Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhri.\n              Apprehending his arrest in this case, the petitioner had\napproached the Court of Sessions seeking grant of pre-arrest bail by filing\nan application, however, his such request was declined by learned\nAdditional Sessions Judge (Exclusive Court for Heinous Crimes against\nWomen and Children), Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhri vide order dated\n2.8.2018. As such, the petitioner has approached this Court asking for\nthe same relief.\n              Notice of the petition was given to respondent - State, which\nput in appearance through counsel. The complainant has also appeared\nthrough counsel.\n              I have heard learned counsel for the parties besides going\nthrough the record and I do not find any merit in the present petition.\n              Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that as a matter\nof fact on 29.12.2017, the complainant Subhash Chand and his family\nmembers had attacked family of petitioner causing injuries to them and on\nthat very day, Smt.Parveena wife of Mahinder Kumar had submitted a\ncomplaint to SHO, Police Station Sadar, Yamuna Nagar regarding the\nincident on which DDR No.7 dated 30.12.2017 was entered in daily diary\nand the present FIR is just a counter-blast to the complaint dated\n29.12.2017 against family members of the complainant.\n              Whereas, learned State counsel and learned counsel for the\ncomplainant submitted that the incident as per FIR in this case took place\non 29.12.2017. Admittedly, no action has been taken on the alleged\ncomplaint submitted by Smt.Parveena regarding Subhash Chand and his\nfamily allegedly attacking family of the petitioner and causing injuries to\nthem. If the police had found merit in the allegations observing that\ncommission of cognizable offence was disclosed, then FIR would have\nnormally been registered, which was not so done, rather it appears that the\nDDR in question was lodged to create defence in the present FIR as a\npressure tactic and to set up a parallel case.\n             After hearing the rival contentions of learned counsel for the\nparties, I find that the incidents of child abuse and molestation of young\ngirls are increasing day by day. It is not safe for the womenfolk to venture\nout of their houses even. A serious law and order problem in that regard is\nfast emerging. In case precautionary measures are not taken at the initial\nstage, the things may get out of hand and would be very difficult to\ncontrol. The persons harassing molesting and sexually abusing young girls\nneed to be dealt with iron hand and no leniency can be shown to them.\nHere the allegations against the petitioner are quite serious and grave. Pre\narrest bail is a discretionary relief and is to be granted in exceptional cases\nand not in routine. It is meant to save the innocent persons from\nharassment and inconvenience and not to screen the culprits from\ncustodial interrogation.\n             Custodial interrogation of the petitioner is definitely required\nfor complete and effective investigation. In case custodial interrogation of\nthe petitioner is denied to the investigating agency that would leave many\nloose ends and gaps in the investigation affecting the investigation being\ncarried out adversely which is not called for.\n             Thus finding no merit in the petition, the same stands\ndismissed.\n\n5.9.2018                                           (H.S.MADAAN)\nBrij                                                   JUDGE\n\nWhether reasoned/speaking :             Yes/No\n\nWhether reportable              :       Yes/No\n\n",
    "Question": "How does the court’s ruling regarding the necessity of custodial interrogation reflect upon the established protocols for handling cases of child sexual abuse, specifically relating to protecting the rights of the victim in this case?",
    "A": "The ruling disregards established protocols as it focuses on the rights of the accused instead of the victim.",
    "B": "The ruling reinforces the need for rigorous investigative procedures that prioritize the victim's rights and ensure thorough investigation in cases of abuse.",
    "C": "The ruling primarily reflects a procedural formality without any substantial impact on victim rights.",
    "D": "The ruling suggests that victim rights are secondary to the procedural rights of the accused.",
    "Correct Answer": "The ruling reinforces the need for rigorous investigative procedures that prioritize the victim's rights and ensure thorough investigation in cases of abuse.",
    "Reasoning": "The court's insistence on the necessity of custodial interrogation for effective investigation underlines its commitment to safeguarding the rights of the victim while pursuing justice in child sexual abuse cases."

P.C. was recorded on 18.07.2018, it is stated that the applicant has been named as one of the person who has sexually assaulted the prosecutrix and consequently he was shown as an accused and chargesheet has been filed in the court of competent jurisdiction. 4. It has been submitted by learned counsel for applicant that the entire story as narrated by the prosecutrix is unbelievable and not worthy of any credence. He submits that the first information report was lodged by the prosecutrix herself and that too after six months of the incident and there is no explanation that as to why the applicant was not named as an accused or any other perosn who has sexually assaulted the prosecutrix in the F.I.R. itself. 5. It has further been submitted that the statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded after six months where again the name of the applicant has not been shown as an accused. He submits that it is in the statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. where the name of the applicant has come up and there is no reason that as to why the applicant was named in the statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. 6. It has further been submitted that D.N.A. test of the child was conducted for comparing to the same with the D.N.A. of the prosecutrix and to the said Prashant Mishra and the D.N.A. testing was confirmed that the father of the child is Prashant Mishra and not the applicant. 7. It has lastly been submitted that the applicant is in jail since 26.06.2020. 8. Learned A.G.A. opposed the prayer for bail and submits that the applicant has clearly named the applicant in the Statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C., therefore the applicant is not entitled for bail looking into the of his complicity in the case. 9. I have heard learned counsel for parties and perused the record. It is clear that there is no reason forth coming as to why the prosecutrix has not named the applicant either in the first information report or in the statement recorded after six months under Section 164 Cr.P.C. Coupled with the fact that the D.N.A. report has not confirmed the parentage of the child to that of the applicant herein and also considering the nature of allegations, arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties as well as the fact that applicant has in jail since 26.06.2020 where he has spent nearly one year in judicial custory, without expressing any opinion on the merit of the case, I find it to be a fit case for granting bail. 10. Let the applicant/Avinash Tripathi involved in Case Crime No. 0108/2018, under Sections 376(D), 506 I.P.C. and 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station - Rajesultanpur, Ambedkar Nagar be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned with the following conditions which are being imposed in the interest of justice:- (i) The applicant shall file an undertaking to the effect that he shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in court.

If in the opinion of the trial court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law. 11. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, the Court below shall be at liberty to cancel the bail and proceed against the applicant in accordance with law. 12.

N.Shanmuga Priya ...Respondent Civil Miscellaneous Appeal filed under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, against the judgment and decree dated 29.03.2012 made in F.C.O.P.No.13 of 2020 on the file of the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, ,Chennai. For Appellant : Mr.V.Balasubramanian For Respondent : Mr.V.Anilkumar JUDGMENT (The Judgement of the Court was delivered by J.Nisha Banu,J.) This Civil Miscellaneous Appeal has been filed as against the judgment and decree dated 29.03.2012 passed in F.C.O.P.No.13/2010 on the file of the Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai, granting divorce.\n\nThe brief facts of the case of the appellant are that the appellant married the respondent on 17.08.2001 as per Christian rites and customs. Due to wedlock, they begotten two children. The respondent/wife filed a petition before the lower Court for divorce on the ground of cruelty and the appellant herein resisted the same by filing counter. However, the lower Court, only on considering the oral evidence adduced by the respondent side has granted the decree of divorce. Hence, the present appeal.\n\nLearned counsel for the appellant would state that the divorce petition was filed on the ground of cruelty but the respondent/wife has not proved that the same. The further allegation of the respondent against the appellant that he is not maintaining the family was also not proved. Even when the respondent was cross examined as P.W.1, she had categorically stated that her father is not helping her for running the family. Therefore, it is proved that only the appellant is maintaining the family. It was also alleged by the respondent that the appellant had assaulted the respondent and the appellant married one Beula. The said allegation was also not proved. The respondent did not give any complaint to the police for assaulting her and she did not file any document to prove the alleged marriage of the appellant with Beula. Without considering all these aspects and without any basis, the lower Court had erroneously passed the decree of divorce as against the appellant. Hence, the learned counsel prays to set aside the judgement and decree passed by the lower Court.\n\nPer contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent would state that though the appellant and the respondent loved each other and got married with the consent of their parents, the appellant did not spare a single paise to meet the domestic expenses and education expenses of the children. When the same was questioned, the appellant assaulted her and abused her in unparliamentary words and harassed her both physically and mentally and the same had become a routine affair in day to day life. Further, the appellant pressurized the respondent to bring more money from her parents for his extravagance. The appellant created unhealthy atmosphere in the marital home. The appellant had association with anti-social elements and was also arrested in a case of attempt to murder and later, remanded to judicial custody. The respondent mobilized funds and spent about Rs.2 lakhs for getting the appellant on bail. But the appellant did not choose to clear the debts borrowed by the respondent for his release on bail. When the respondent advised him to rectify his adamant character, he threatened her and assaulted her. Further, the appellant developed intimacy with another lady viz., R.Beula. When the respondent lodged a complaint against him before the All Women Police Station, he accepted that he had married her. Thereafter, the appellant deserted the respondent and two children and is living with the said Beula. The appellant had deserted the respondent and two children and unable to tolerate the cruelty, the respondent came under the shelter of her parents along with her children. Therefore, the learned counsel for the respondent would state that only on considering all the above factual aspects, the lower court had granted the decree of divorce and the same need not be interfered with.\n\nHeard the learned counsel for the appellant, learned counsel for the respondent and perused the materials available on record.\n\nIt is not in dispute that the respondent is a Hindu and the appellant is a Christian and they got married as per the Christian rites and customs. Due to wedlock, two children were born to them. From the records, it is seen that the appellant did not provide any monetary help to the respondent. The evidence of P.W.2, who is the father of the respondent, would also go to show that he is only looking after his daughter and her children till date and the appellant used abusive language and beat his daughter when she questioned his irresponsible behaviour. The second marriage of the appellant with one Beula and that he got a girl child through Beula was also proved by examining one P.W.3, who is none other than the cousin brother of the appellant. Contracting second marriage while the first marriage is in existence would not only amount to bigamy but also amount to cruelty. In view of the above, we are of the view that the lower Court, on considering the oral and documentary evidence had rightly granted divorce on the ground cruelty, with which, we find no infirmity or illegality to interfere with. Accordingly, the Civil Miscellaneous Appeal fails and the same stands dismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.",

The respondent in this original petition had filed the above application seeking interim custody of his minor son Dhanvin and permission to interact with his younger son Sidharth during holidays and vacation periods. In the application filed before the Family Court, the respondent had, inter alia, pleaded that, after the birth of the younger child, the petitioner refused to return to the matrimonial home. Subsequently, there was a mediation, and a rapprochement was effected. Immediately after conceiving the younger child, the petitioner went to her parental home and thereafter, has refused to resume co-habitation. The respondent is anxious to look after the welfare of the children, but the petitioner is not permitting the same. Therefore, interim custody of the older child may be given to him, and he be permitted to interact with the younger child. The application was opposed by the petitioner, who filed a written objection, inter alia, contending that the respondent is an alcoholic. Subsequent to the separation between them, there was a settlement before the Police, and the older child was agreed to be given on every Friday. However, the respondent's close friend Jayesh abused the child, and on a complaint by the petitioner, Crime No.93/2019 was registered by the Guruvayoor Police Station, for offences punishable under POCSO Act and under Section 377 of IPC against Jayesh. Hence custody of the child shall not be given to the petitioner. The petitioner hence prays that the application may be dismissed. The Family Court after considering the application and the counter filed, and also after interacting with the child, who did not raise any complaint against the father, held that by merely raising allegations of sexual assault against the respondent's friend, the respondent cannot be restricted from having interim custody and visitation rights of his children. Accordingly, the Family Court allowed I.A.No.1162/2019 by granting interim custody of the older child to the respondent from 11 a.m. of every 2nd Saturday till 3 p.m. on the following Sunday, with visitation right from 11 am to 1 pm on every 4th Sunday. Likewise, the respondent was permitted to interact with the younger child from 10 am to 11 am on every 2nd Saturday and from 11 am to 1 pm on every 4th Sunday. It is challenging the above order this original petition is filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, contending that the impugned order passed by the Family Court is erroneous and improper and is liable to be set aside. This Court in Suhara and Others v. Muhammed Jaleel [2019 (2) KLT 960] has held that, even if one of the parents is accused of an allegation in a crime under the POCSO Act, is no assurance to a Family court that the allegation is true. The Court has to consider the paramount welfare and interest of the child while granting custody of the child to such parent, and further that the registration of the crime is not a bar in granting the parent access and visitation right of the child. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Anjali Kapoor vs. Rajiv Baijal [(2009) 7 SCC 322] has categorically declared the law that in a battle for custody of the child, Court should see what would best serve the welfare and interest of the child, which is the soul and predominant criteria and not the legal rights of the warring parents. In a most recent decision by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Yashita Sahu vs State of Rajasthan and others [2020 SCC OnLine (SC) 50] rendered on 20.1.2020, has declared as follows: 'The child is the victim in custody battles. In this fight of egos and increasing acrimonious battles and litigations between two spouses, our experience shows that more often than not, the parents who otherwise love their child, present a picture as if the other spouse is a villain and he or she alone is entitled to the custody of the child. The court must therefore be very vary of what is said by each of the spouses. A child, especially a child of tender years requires the love, affection, company, protection of both parents. This is not only the requirement of the child but is his/her basic human right. Just because the parents are at war with each other, does not mean that the child should be denied the care, affection, love or protection of any one of the two parents. A child is not an inanimate object which can be tossed from one parent to the other. Every separation, every re-union may have a traumatic and psychosomatic impact on the child. Therefore, it is to be ensured that the court weighs each and every circumstance very carefully before deciding how and in what manner the custody of the child should be shared between both the parents. Even if the custody is given to one parent the other parent must have sufficient visitation rights to ensure that the child keeps in touch with the other parent and does not lose social, physical and psychological contact with any one of the two parents. It is only in extreme circumstances that one parent should be denied contact with the child. Reasons must be assigned if one parent is to be denied any visitation rights or contact with the child. Courts dealing with the custody matters must while deciding issues of custody clearly define the nature, manner and specifics of the visitation rights.' Undisputedly, in the present case the allegation is that, the respondent's friend and neighbour attempted to abuse the child and he is accused in POCSO case, therefore, the child shall not be given to the respondent. In view of the categoric declaration of law in the authoritative precedents cited supra, we are unable to accept the contentions that the handing over of the custody of the older child to the respondent would be detrimental to the paramount welfare and best interest of the older child, and that the respondent should be denied visitation rights of the younger child. The learned Judge of the Family Court had interacted with the older child and found that he has no complaint to go with his father and that there is no harm if the older child is being sent with the father on every 2nd Saturday till the following Sunday. Similarly, the father has been given visitation right to see the younger child also on every 2nd Saturday and 4th Sunday. The granting of interim custody and visitation rights would only benefit their paramount welfare and best interest. It is the welfare of the children that is to be looked into and not the rights and defences of the quarrelling parents. We do not find any ground warranting interference with the impugned order invoking the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The original petition is without merit. Accordingly, the Original Petition is dismissed.",

Anticipatory Bail Application U/S 438 Cr.P.C. No. 8072 of 2020, Govind Mishra @ Chhotu Versus State of U.P., hence, this anticipatory bail application is being heard. Grant of further time to the learned A.G.A as per Section 438 (3) Cr.P.C. (U.P. Amendment) is not required.\n\nThere is allegation of enticement of minor girl against the applicant. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that at the relevant time the girl was not minor. She has married with the applicant. The applicant has been falsely implicated in this case. The victim has not supported the prosecution case in her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C.. The present application is supported by the affidavit of the girl herself. A child has been born out of their wedlock. Therefore, it would not be in the interest of justice not to grant protection to the applicant since there is no one to look after his family. She is living with the applicant. The charge sheet has already been submitted against the applicant. The applicant will cooperate with the trial. He has no criminal history to his credit. The applicant has a definite apprehension that he may be arrested by the police any time.\n\nLearned A.G.A. has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail of the applicant. He has submitted that in view of the seriousness of the allegations made against the applicant, he is not entitled to grant of anticipatory bail. The apprehension of the applicant is not founded on any material on record. Only on the basis of imaginary fear, anticipatory bail cannot be granted.\n\nAfter considering the rival submissions, this Court finds that there is a case registered against the applicant. It cannot be definitely said when the police may apprehend him. After the lodging of F.I.R, the arrest can be made by the police at will. There is no definite period fixed for the police to arrest an accused against whom an F.I.R has been lodged. The courts have repeatedly held that arrest should be the last option for the police and it should be restricted to those exceptional cases where arresting the accused is imperative or his custodial interrogation is required. Irrational and indiscriminate arrests are gross violation of human rights. In the case of Joginder Kumar v. State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 1994 SC 1349, the Apex Court has referred to the third report of National Police Commission wherein it is mentioned that arrests by the police in India is one of the chief sources of corruption in the police. The report suggested that, by and large, nearly 60 percent of the arrests were either unnecessary or unjustified and that such unjustified police action accounted for 43.2 percent of expenditure of the jails. Personal liberty is a very precious fundamental right and it should be curtailed only when it becomes imperative. According to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the arrest of an accused should be made.\n\nHence without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and considering the nature of accusations and antecedents of applicant and also the second surge in the cases of novel coronavirus and possibility of further surge of the pandemic, he is directed to be enlarged on anticipatory bail as per the Constitution Bench judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Sushila Aggarwal vs. State (NCT of Delhi)- 2020 SCC Online SC 98. The future contingencies regarding anticipatory bail being granted to applicant shall also be taken care of as per the aforesaid judgment of the Apex Court.\n\nIn the event of arrest, the applicant shall be released on anticipatory bail. Let the applicant involved in the aforesaid crime be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing a personal bond with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court concerned with the following conditions:-\n\n1. The applicant shall, at the time of execution of the bond, furnish his address and mobile number and shall not change the residence till the conclusion of investigation/ trial without informing the Investigating Officer of the police/ the Court concerned of change of address and the reasons for the same before changing the same.\n\n2. The applicant shall not leave the country during the pendency of trial/investigation by police without prior permission from the concerned trial Court.\n\n3. The applicant shall not obstruct or hamper the police investigation and not play mischief with the evidence collected or yet to be collected by the Investigating Officer of the police;\n\n4. The applicant shall surrender his passport, if any, to the concerned Court/Investigating Officer forthwith. His passport will remain in custody of the concerned Court/ Investigating Officer till the investigation is completed. In case he has no passport, he will file his affidavit before the Court/ Investigating Officer concerned in this regard.\n\n5. That the applicant shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer;\n\n6. The applicant shall maintain law and order.\n\n7. The applicant shall file an undertaking to the effect that he shall not seek any adjournment before the trial court on the dates fixed for evidence and when the witnesses are present in court. In case of default of this condition, it shall be open for the trial court to treat it as an abuse of liberty of bail and pass orders in accordance with law to ensure presence of the applicant.\n\n8. In case, the applicant misuses the liberty of bail, the Court concerned may take appropriate action in accordance with law and judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Sushila Aggarwal vs. State (NCT of Delhi)- 2020 SCC Online SC 98 and the Government Advocate/informant/complainant can file bail cancellation application.\n\n9. The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on the dates fixed for (i) opening of the case, (ii) framing of charge and (iii) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. If in the opinion of the trial court, a default of this condition is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as an abuse of the liberty of her bail and proceed against him in accordance with law.\n\n10. The party shall file computer generated copy of such order downloaded from the official website of High Court Allahabad.\n\n11. The concerned Court/Authority/Official shall verify the authenticity of such computerized copy of the order from the official website of High Court Allahabad and shall make a declaration of such verification in writing.\n\n12. The applicant is warned not to get himself implicated in any crime and should keep distance from the informant and not to misuse the liberty granted hereby. Any misuse of liberty granted by this Court would be viewed seriously against the applicant in further proceedings.\n\nThis anticipatory bail application is being allowed on account of special conditions and on special ground. The normal grounds, settled for the grant of anticipatory bail, have not been considered by this Court and it would be open for the applicant to approach this Court again, if so advised, in changed circumstances.\n\nThe anticipatory bail application is allowed.",

The appellant has challenged the judgment dated 31.7.2002 passed by the Addl. Sessions Judge (Fast Track), Jhunjhunu whereby the appellant has been convicted for offences under Section 377 and 302 IPC. For the former offence, the appellant has been sentenced to 10 years R.I. and fined Rs. 500/- and to further undergo a sentence to fifteen days of simple imprisonment in default thereof. For the latter offence, he has been sentenced to life imprisonment and fined Rs. 2,000/- and to further undergo two months simple imprisonment in default thereof. The brief facts of the case are that on 7.9.2000 Chhala Ram (PW-1) lodged a report (Ex.P. 1) at Police Station, Chirawa wherein he claimed that 'his young son Mintu, aged eight years, was missing from the afternoon of 2.9.2000. The boy had left the house at 12'O clock in order to play. However, when the body did not return back home till 7'O clock in the evening, he started to search for him. He was told that the child was seen leaving the house of Jai Prakash and after that he was not seen. Therefore, on 3.9.2000 he had filed a report for the missing child. He further claimed that in the morning of the 7th, at 6'0 clock, some of the villagers gathered and they started searching near the river. Around 9'O clock Bakhtawar and Jainarain Sharma, who went on the east side of the river among the tall grasses, discovered the dead body of his son and his clothes. He suspected that someone has killed his son. On the basis of the said report the police chalked out a former FIR, FIR No. 226/2000, and commenced the investigation. On the same day, the appellant was arrested as some of the witnesses had stated that they had seen the deceased on the last occasion with the appellant. Eventually, the police filed a charge-sheet for the offences under Section 377 and 302 IPC against the appellant. In order to prove its case the prosecution examined 15 witnesses and submitted 29 documents. Although the defence did not examine any witness, but it did submit the statement of Bakhtawar recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. as a document.

Heard Mr. Anil Kumar Mishra, the learned counsel for applicants, the learned A.G.A. for State and Mr. Vijay Prakash Chaturvedi, the learned counsel representing victim. At the outset, the learned A.G.A. submits that notice of application under Section 482 was served upon first informant. However, no counter affidavit has been filed. The applicants, charge sheeted accused, have approached the Court for quashing the proceedings due to subsequent marriage with the prosecutrix, arguing the prosecution cannot be sustained. The prosecutrix has solemnized marriage with applicant on 17.01.2024. Parties entered a settlement outside Court and jointly filed an application for terminating the criminal proceedings. However, the A.G.A. opposed this, asserting that the prosecutrix was a child under the POCSO Act at the time of the offence, hence, the criminality stands. The counsel for the victim stated no objection to quashing the proceedings. This Court noted that compromise between parties can lead to quashing proceedings under certain conditions but risks remain with serious offences like those under POCSO. The court weighed public interest against the facts of the case. It concluded that the marriage and the victim's lawyer supports the application suggesting the criminality stands washed off, allowing the application and quashing the proceedings.",

    "Passage": "Smt. Tammanna And Another vs State Of U.P. And 5 Others on 30 July, 2019\n\n?Court No. - 42\n\nCase :- HABEAS CORPUS WRIT PETITION No. - 723 of 2019\n\nPetitioner :- Smt. Tammanna And Another\n\nRespondent :- State Of U.P. And 5 Others\n\nCounsel for Petitioner :- Ved Mani Sharma\n\nCounsel for Respondent :- G.A.\n\nHon'ble Manoj Misra,J.\n\nHon'ble Virendra Kumar Srivastava,J.\n\nHeard learned counsel for the petitioners; the learned A.G.A. for the respondents 1 to 5; and perused the record.\n\nThis habeas corpus petition has been filed with multiple prayers, one of them is that a writ in the nature of certiorari be issued quashing the order dated 06.07.2019 passed by the Child Welfare Committee, Shahjahanpur by which the corpus Tammanna has been placed in the care and protection of Children Protection Home (Girls), Hathaura Bujurg, Shahjahanpur.\n\nA perusal of the record would reveal that Case Crime No. 149 of 2019 was registered at P.S. Jalalabad, District Shahjahanpur, under Sections 363, 366 I.P.C. and section 7/8 Pocso Act on the FIR lodged by Asif (respondent no.6), father of the corpus, wherein it was alleged that Tamanna (minor daughter of the informant) was enticed away by accused persons including the petitioner no.2. The corpus was recovered and produced before the Child Welfare Committee. The Child Welfare Committee found that the educational certificate of the victim disclosed her date of birth as 08.05.2003 though medical examination of the victim suggested that she was above 18 years. The Child Welfare Committee accorded primacy to the date of birth entered in the educational certificate and, as the victim had refused to go with her parents, directed her placement in the Child Protection Home (girls) in exercise of power conferred by Section 37 (1)(c) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (for short J.J. Act, 2015)\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that in a Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 9222 of 2019, the arrest of the accused (petitioner no.2) has been stayed after considering the statement of the victim and the date of birth in her adhar card as per which she is an adult. \n\nLearned A.G.A. has submitted that entry of date of birth entered in the adhar card is not conclusive with regard to its holder and as the age of a child victim is to be determined by applying the principles embodied in Section 94 of the J. J. Act, 2015, under which, primacy is to be accorded to date of birth entered in educational certificate over medical evidence, the order of the Child Welfare Committee is not illegal or perverse so as to warrant issuance of writ of habeas corpus or to invoke the writ jurisdiction, particularly, when alternative remedy is available under Section 101 of the J.J. Act, 2015.\n\nHaving noticed the rival submissions, before we proceed to address the issues, it would be apposite to observe that the Apex Court had consistently been of the view that the principles applicable for determining the age of juvenile in conflict with law are to be applied for determining the age of child victim (vide Jarnail Singh Vs. State of Haryana, (2013) 7 SCC 263; State of M.P. Vs. Anoop Singh, (2015) 7 SCC 773; and Mahadeo Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2013) 14 SCC 637).\n\nSection 94 of the J. J. Act, 2015 provides for presumption and determination of age. Sub-section (2) of section 94 of the J. J. Act, 2015, which is relevant, is extracted below:\n\n\"(2) In case, the Committee or the Board has reasonable grounds for doubt regarding whether the person brought before it is a child or not, the Committee or the Board, as the case may be, shall undertake the process of age determination, by seeking evidence by obtaining--\n\n(i) the date of birth certificate from the school, or the matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned examination Board, if available; and in the absence thereof;\n\n(ii) the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat;\n\n(iii) and only in the absence of (i) and (ii) above, age shall be determined by an ossification test or any other latest medical age determination test conducted on the orders of the Committee or the Board:\n\nProvided such age determination test conducted on the order of the Committee or the Board shall be completed within fifteen days from the date of such order.\"\n\nFrom above, it is clear that primacy is to be accorded to the date of birth certificate from the school, or the matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned examination Board, and, in the absence thereof, to the birth certificate given by a corporation or municipality or panchayat. Only in absence of above evidence, medical evidence is to be taken.\n\nSection 37 (1) (c) of the J. J. Act, 2015 empowers the Child Welfare Committee to place a child in need of care and protection in a Children's Home or fit facility for temporary care.\n\nSection 2 (14) of the J. J. Act, 2015 defines a child in need of care and protection. Clauses (iii), (viii) (xii) of sub-section (14) of Section 2 of the J. J. Act, 2015 are relevant for the purpose of deciding this case. The said clauses along with the opening part of sub-section (14) of section 2 of the J. J. Act, 2015 are extracted below:\n\n\"Section 2(14) \"child in need of care and protection\" means a child--\n\n(iii) who resides with a person (whether a guardian of the child or not) and such person--\n\n(a) has injured, exploited, abused or neglected the child or has violated any other law for the time being in force meant for the protection of child; or\n\n(b) has threatened to kill, injure, exploit or abuse the child and there is a reasonable likelihood of the threat being carried out; or\n\n(c) has killed, abused, neglected or exploited some other child or children and there is a reasonable likelihood of the child in question being killed, abused, exploited or neglected by that person; or\n\n(iv) to (vii).............................................\n\n(viii) who has been or is being or is likely to be abused, tortured or exploited for the purpose of sexual abuse or illegal acts; or\n\n(ix) to (xi)..........................; or\n\n(xii) who is at imminent risk of marriage before attaining the age of marriage and whose parents, family members, guardian and any other persons are likely to be responsible for solemnisation of such marriage;\"\n\nIn Independent Thought v. Union of India, (2017) 10 SCC 800, the apex court after taking a conspectus of the provisions contained in the Constitution of India, the Indian Penal Code, the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (Pocso Act) and the J. J. Act, 2015, held as follows:\n\n\"107. On a complete assessment of the law and the documentary material, it appears that there are really five options before us: (i) To let the incongruity remain as it is -- this does not seem a viable option to us, given that the lives of thousands of young girls are at stake; (ii) To strike down as unconstitutional Exception 2 to Section 375 IPC -- in the present case this is also not a viable option since this relief was given up and no such issue was raised; (iii) To reduce the age of consent from 18 years to 15 years -- this too is not a viable option and would ultimately be for Parliament to decide; (iv) To bring the POCSO Act in consonance with Exception 2 to Section 375 IPC -- this is also not a viable option since it would require not only a retrograde amendment to the POCSO Act but also to several other pro-child statutes; (v) To read Exception 2 to Section 375 IPC in a purposive manner to make it in consonance with the POCSO Act, the spirit of other pro-child legislations and the human rights of a married girl child. Being purposive and harmonious constructionists, we are of opinion that this is the only pragmatic option available. Therefore, we are left with absolutely no other option but to harmonise the system of laws relating to children and require Exception 2 to Section 375 IPC to now be meaningfully read as: \"Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape.\" It is only through this reading that the intent of social justice to the married girl child and the constitutional vision of the Framers of our Constitution can be preserved and protected and perhaps given impetus.\"\n\nIn view of the decision of the apex court in Independent Thought's case, the benefit of Exception 2 to Section 375 I.P.C. may not be available to even husband of a girl who has not attained the age of 18 years.\n\nIn the instant case, the Child Welfare Committee, by order dated 06.07.2019, directed the corpus to be placed in Child Protection Home (girls) upon finding her to be minor, with date of birth 08.05.2003, as per her educational certificate.\n\nIn the writ petition though it is stated that the victim is illiterate but there is no specific effort to challenge the authenticity of the educational certificate on which the Child Welfare Committee has placed reliance. Further, neither copy of the certificate has been produced nor the name of the institution has been disclosed to enable the court to test the authenticity of the certificate with the help of State agencies. Admittedly, Adhar Card entry in respect of date of birth is not accorded primacy over entry of date of birth in educational certificate. Rather, as per Section 94 of the J.J. Act primacy is to be accorded to the date of birth entered in the educational records. Further, medical evidence is to be accorded consideration only when there is no educational certificate or date of birth certificate available.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the medical report pertaining to the age of the corpus is not liable to be considered at this stage and in these proceedings, in as much as primacy is to be accorded to the date of birth recorded in educational certificate over medical evidence.\n\nOnce the corpus is found a child, as defined by Section 2 (12) of the J.J. Act, 2015, and, allegedly, a victim of a crime (in this case Case Crime No.149 of 2019 detailed above), she would fall in the category of child in need of care and protection in view of clauses (iii), (viii) and (xii) of sub-section (14) of section 2 of the J. J. Act, 2015. Hence, the order passed by the Child Welfare Committee placing the corpus in a protection home would be within its powers conferred by section 37 of the J.J. Act, 2015.\n\nIn view of the above, as the corpus is in Protection Home pursuant to an order passed by the Child Welfare Committee, which is neither without jurisdiction nor illegal or perverse, keeping in mind the provisions of the J.J. Act, 2015, the detention of the corpus cannot be said to be illegal so as to warrant issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. If the petitioner is aggrieved by the order of the Child Welfare Committee, the petitioner is at liberty to take recourse to the remedy of an appeal provided under Section 101 of the J. J. Act, 2015. \n\nSubject to above, the petition is disposed off.\nOrder Date :- 30.7.2019/Sunil Kr Tiwari",
    "Question": "What legal reasoning underpins the Child Welfare Committee's decision to place Tammanna in a Child Protection Home, and how does this relate to her status as a minor under the law? Could any potential grounds for appeal exist based on the information provided regarding her age?",
    "A": "The Child Welfare Committee's decision is based exclusively on Tammanna's refusal to go with her parents, disregarding any age considerations.",
    "B": "The Committee is bound to follow the educational certificate's date of birth as the final authority in determining her age over any medical opinions available.",
    "C": "Tammanna's age was determined primarily by her Adhar card, making the decision invalid.",
    "D": "Tammanna's placement is irrelevant as she is not considered a minor in the eyes of the law.",
    "Correct Answer": "The Committee is bound to follow the educational certificate's date of birth as the final authority in determining her age over any medical opinions available.",
    "Reasoning": "The Child Welfare Committee relies on the date of birth from the educational certificate, giving it primacy as required by Section 94 of the J. J. Act, 2015, despite medical evidence suggesting otherwise. Therefore, this establishes the basis for Tammanna’s placement as a minor rather than her medical assessment, sustaining a potential grounds for appeal based on the certificate's authenticity."

    "Passage": "This criminal revision is directed against a judgment and order of the Exclusive Judge, POCSO Act, Fatehpur dated 01.12.2020, made in Criminal Appeal No. 25 of 2020, affirming an order of the Juvenile Justice Board, Fatehpur dated 30.09.2020, declining bail to the revisionist pending trial. The prosecution case, shortly put, is that on 25.04.2020, at about 03:32 in the afternoon, a Non-Cognizable Report bearing number 57 of 2020, was got lodged by the informant/opposite party no. 2, Dharmendra Kumar, with Police Station - Hussainganj, District - Fatehpur, under Sections 323 and 504 of the Indian Penal Code, 186 with allegations that 2 O' Clock earlier in the day, Pradeep son of Rakesh, Pappu son of Naresh, Manish son of Santosh (the revisionist) and Santosh son of Rahimal, intruded into his house over the issue of not permitting a drain to be cleaned. They beat up the informant, delivering blows, besides employing sticks (danda). The informant's uncle, Suresh, who attempted to rescue him, was also battered and abused. The informant's uncle, Suresh, who was taken to the Fatehpur Sadar Hospital for attending to his injuries, had died. The FIR requested necessary action. It appears that the case was then converted to a regular crime, bearing Case Crime No. 78 of 2020, under Sections 323, 504, 304/34 IPC, Police Station - Hussainganj, District - Fatehpur. The revisionist, being one of the assailants nominated, is in jail. He applied to the Board, seeking to be declared a child in conflict with law, under the provision of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.",
    "Question": "In the context of child protection laws, what is the significance of the revisionist, Manish Kumar, being identified as a juvenile in conflict with law in this case? How does this classification affect his legal rights and the proceedings regarding his bail application?",
    "A": "His status as a juvenile does not affect his legal rights in any way.",
    "B": "Being classified as a juvenile means he is afforded protections under the Juvenile Justice Act, including a presumptive right to bail unless specific conditions are met.",
    "C": "His being a juvenile automatically makes him guilty of the crimes charged.",
    "D": "Juvenile status allows him to avoid any legal proceedings altogether.",
    "Correct Answer": "Being classified as a juvenile means he is afforded protections under the Juvenile Justice Act, including a presumptive right to bail unless specific conditions are met.",
    "Reasoning": "According to the passage, Manish Kumar is recognized as a juvenile under the Juvenile Justice Act. This classification grants him special protections, including a presumption of bail unless there are reasonable grounds to deny it, thereby significantly influencing the nature of the legal proceedings he faces."

    "Passage": "State vs Rohit @ Sonu on 4 May, 2018 IN THE COURT OF SHRI BALWANT RAI BANSAL, ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE­01, SPECIAL COURT (POCSO), SOUTH, NEW DELHI CIS­SC No.530/17 FIR No.410/17 PS: Mehrauli In the matter of: State versus Rohit @ Sonu S/o: Sh. Ashok Chauhan R/o: House No.363, Firoz Gandhi Colony, Basai Road, Gurugram, Haryana. ............ Accused. Date of Institution : 23.09.2017. Date of Reserving Judgment : Unreserved. Date of Pronouncement : 04.05.2018. Accused Rohit @ Sonu S/o Sh. Ashok Chauhan has been facing trial for the commission of the offences punishable under section 6 r/w 5 of the POCSO Act 2012 and section 376 (2) of the IPC, on the allegations that, he committed rape and aggravated penetrative sexual assault upon the girl child (the victim/prosecutrix), namely, 'N' (PW1, whose real name withheld in order to conceal her identity), aged 16 years. The brief facts of the case are that on 23.06.2017, the prosecutrix came to the PS­ Mehrauli and made a complaint to the police that she was sexually abused by a boy, namely, Rohit @ Sonu by promising to marry her. She also alleged that she also got pregnant and when she disclosed this fact to Rohit, he suggested her to terminate the pregnancy and on his persistent advice, she ate hot things due to which, her pregnancy was terminated. She alleged that on 19.06.2017, Rohit made physical relations with her lastly and on 20.06.2017, despite her repeated insistence, he refused to marry with her. Making the said complaint, the prosecutrix prayed for legal action against accused Rohit. Thereafter, the site plan of the place of occurrence was prepared at the instance of the prosecutrix and accused Rohit was arrested. The prosecutrix and the accused were medically examined. The statement of the prosecutrix was also recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. During the course of the investigation, the age proof of the prosecutrix was also collected. After completion of the investigation, the charge­sheet was prepared and filed in the court concerned for the commission of the offences punishable under sections 313/376 of the IPC and section 6 of the POCSO Act 2012. Charge for the commission of the offences punishable under section 6 of the POCSO Act and section 376 (2) of the IPC was framed against the accused Rohit @ Sonu, to which, the accused pleaded not­guilty and claimed trial, and the case was proceeded for prosecution evidence. In the list of witnesses, the prosecution cited 16 witnesses, out of which, two witnesses, including the prosecutrix as PW1 and her mother as PW2, have been examined so far. It is submitted by Ld. Counsel for the accused that the prosecutrix who is the main witness of the prosecution has already been examined as PW1 alongwith her mother as PW2, who is the hearsay witness, and no other public witness remained to be examined. He submitted that PW1, who is the main and crucial witness, has not supported the case of the prosecution. The Ld. Counsel has submitted that since nothing incriminating evidence has come against the accused, therefore, to save the precious time and manpower and resources of the court, the further proceedings in the present case may be stopped, and the accused may be acquitted of the offences charged against him. On the other hand, the Ld. Special Public Prosecutor has opposed the contentions made by the counsel for the accused. I have considered the submissions made on behalf of both the parties and have gone through the record of the case. There are 16 witnesses cited by the prosecution in the list of witnesses, to prove its case. Out of the said 16 prosecution witnesses, two witnesses have already been examined, including the prosecutrix as PW1. It is pertinent to evaluate herein the testimony of PW1, who is the main and important witness of the prosecution, to decide the fate of the case. PW1, the prosecutrix 'N' (full particulars are mentioned at Sl. No.01 in the list of the witnesses and the name withheld in order to conceal her identity) deposed that on 19.06.2017, it was the birthday of Rohit and they had celebrated his birthday in her house and thereafter, they went for shopping. In the evening, after shopping, Rohit dropped her to her house. She was asking him to marry her but he was not giving the clear answer and therefore, a quarrel took place between them. On the next day, he did not pick up her phone and she went to the police station and told the police that she was having friendship with Rohit for the last 4 ­ 5 years and he is not picking her phone. She stated that police obtained her signatures on some blank papers. She deposed that Rohit did not do any wrongful act with her and they were only friends. She deposed that she has married with Rohit on 23.08.2017. PW1 (the prosecutrix) was cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor and during her cross­examination, she denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor. PW2, namely, 'S' (full particulars withheld in order to conceal the identity) is the mother of the prosecutrix, who also turned hostile. In her evidence, she stated that her victim daughter was having friendly relations with Rohit being the neighbour, and she did not tell about their relationship or that Rohit has committed any wrongful act with her. PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix) was also cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor, in which, she also denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor. As already mentioned, the accused has been facing trial for the commission of offences punishable under section 376 (2) of IPC and section 6 of POCSO Act. As per the case of the prosecution, the prosecutrix was raped by the accused since March 2015 till 19.06.2017, on several occasions, on the pretext of marriage, and also got pregnant, and the accused got her pregnancy terminated. PW1 (the prosecutrix) categorically stated that on 19.06.2017, on the day of the birthday of the accused, they had celebrated the birthday in her house and thereafter, they went for shopping. She stated that in the evening, after shopping, Rohit dropped her to her house. She also stated that she was asking him to marry her but he was not giving the clear answer and therefore, a quarrel took place between them, and on the next day when he did not pick up her phone, she went to the police station and told the police that she was having friendship with the accused for the last 4­5 years and he is not picking up her phone call. She categorically stated that the police obtained her signatures on some blank papers. She specifically stated that accused Rohit did not do any wrongful act with her and they were only friends. She stated that on 23.08.2017, she had married with the accused. In her cross­examination by the Ld. Prosecutor, she categorically denied the suggestion that in March 2015, at about 10:00am, when her mother had gone for job and her siblings were at school and she was alone, Rohit came to her house and he proposed her for marriage. She also denied the suggestions that thereafter, Rohit made physical relationship with her consent or that thereafter, she had also introduced Rohit with her mother or that Rohit also talked with her mother for their marriage and her mother had agreed for the same. She also denied the suggestion that on 05.01.2017, Rohit refused to marry her and told her that if she would pressurize to marry him, then he would defame her in her relations. PW1 (the prosecutrix) categorically denied the suggestion put by the Ld. Prosecutor that Rohit made physical relationship with her on the pretext of marriage after alluring and enticing her. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that Rohit has been making physical relationship with her for the last two years. She also denied the correctness of the suggestions that during the period December 2016 to March 2017, she also became pregnant and when she told the same to Rohit, he asked her to terminate the pregnancy or that on his persistent advice, she ate hot things due to which her pregnancy was terminated. She also denied the suggestion that on 19.06.2017, accused Rohit came to her house for celebrating his birthday and on the said day, he lastly made physical relationship with her. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that the site plan Ex.PW1/B was prepared by the police at her instance. As per the MLC report of the prosecutrix, the sexual assault history narrated to the doctor is 'consensual sexual intercourse with Mr. Rohit who promised to marry her, and the last sexual intercourse was held on 19.06.2017'. However, PW1 (the prosecutrix) also denied the correctness of the suggestion put by the Ld. Prosecutor that at the time of her medical examination by the doctor, she had told to the doctor that she had consensual sexual relationship with accused Rohit. On seeing her statement Ex.PW1/E under section 164 Cr.P.C., she voluntarily stated that she had given the said statement to the Magistrate on the advice of Priyanka Madam who was the police official, as she had told her that if she would not give the said statement, her marriage would not be solemnized with Rohit. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that she had told to the Magistrate all the true and correct facts voluntarily and on her own and not at the advice of the police official Priyanka. On the other hand, while evaluating the testimony of PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix), who is a hearsay witness, it reveals that she has also not supported the case of the prosecution at all, stating that her victim daughter was having friendly relations with Rohit being the neighbour, and her victim daughter did not tell her about her relationship with the accused Rohit or that Rohit has committed any wrongful act with her, and this witness was also cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor. In her cross­examination by the Ld. Prosecutor, PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix) denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor that her victim daughter had told her that she loved Rohit and wanted to marry him, or that on her insistence, her victim daughter told her that they had also made physical relationship with each other. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that on 20.06.2017, her victim daughter told her that Rohit and his family members are refusing to marry with her. She also denied having ever made statement Mark­PW2/A to the police. In view of the aforesaid discussions, particularly, keeping in view the testimony of PW1 (the prosecutrix), in my considered opinion, no useful purpose will be served by examining the remaining prosecution witnesses, as it will not affect the fate of the case. The other prosecution witnesses are formal witnesses, most of which are police officials. There is no medical and forensic evidence on record to prove the case of the prosecution that the accused had made physical relations with the victim. In these circumstances, continuing with this trial any further, will only result in wastage of time and resources, and there will be no impact on the result of this trial. Hence, the prosecution evidence has been closed and the SA of the accused has been dispensed with. In the overall facts and circumstances of the case and the aforesaid discussions, there being no evidence against the accused, accused Rohit @ Sonu is entitled to be acquitted, and accordingly, the accused is not found guilty of committing the offences punishable under sections 376 (2) of IPC and section 6 read with section 5 of POCSO Act, and consequently, he is acquitted of the said offences. However, Rohit @ Sonu is required to furnish bail bond in the sum of Rs.10,000/­ with one surety of like amount, under section 437A of Cr.P.C, which shall remain in force for a period of six months.

    "Passage": "Aggrieved by the order of learned Sessions Judge, Dhrangadhra in Sessions Case No. 24 of 2014 dated 8th April 2015, the present revision application has been preferred seeking to challenge the order of rejection of discharge application of the applicants-accused. It is the case of prosecution that the prosecutrix and her parents followed Islam. The marriage of prosecutrix with the original accused no. 7 and the applicant no. 1 herein was performed as per the Muslim Personal law and with the consent of the parties the Nikah had been performed. Under section 11 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 ['POCSO' for short] so also under section 3 & 16 of the said Act and also under Section 376 read with 114 IPC, after the investigation, the chargesheet had been laid. It is the case of the applicants that Islam permits marriage at the age of 15 years, therefore, the limitation prescribed under the law for marriage of 18 years for the girl would not come in the way of the applicants. Moreover, the Court added Sections 4 & 17 of the POCSO which are the provisions prescribed for punishment under Section 3 and 16 respectively, that also has aggrieved the applicants. Learned advocate Mr. Malik appearing for all the applicants has urged that it is an internal dispute of the family which has brought to the fore the factum of child marriage. He has urged that the girl's statement also reveals that the paternal uncle of the girl since did not enjoy good relationship with the family, has complained against such marriage. He urged that the applicants are not only aggrieved by imposition of Section 4 & 17 of the POSCO but also for non grant of their application where they made a request for discharge from all the offences. He has fervently urged that the radiological report is clearly indicative of the fact that the prosecutrix is between 16 -18 years and therefore also, this Court requires to interfere with the order of discharge passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Dhrangadhra. Learned APP Ms. Punani has urged that the very object of the Act of 2012 is to protect the children who are not adequately protected, as they require security at the tender age. She urged that the age of prosecutrix was 13 years at the time of her so-called marriage, and therefore, the trial Court was right in not discharging the applicants-accused of the charges levelled against them. She further urged that Section 3 of the POSCO Act, 2012 speaks of penetrative sexual assault; Section 4 prescribes punishment for penetrative sexual assault and Section 16 likewise is with respect to abetment of an offence and section 17 prescribes punishment for abetment. Such additions, therefore, would not warrant any interference. Having thus heard both the sides, for the reasons to follow hereinafter, this application deserves dismissal. When there is sufficient ground existing for the Court to frame the charges on the basis of evidence that may be adduced by the prosecution by way of paper of chargesheet, the Court can frame the charges. Once the case is presented to the Court, it is required of the Court to sift through the material and it becomes its bounden duty to ensure that the reasonable ground is made out from such material for the Court to frame the charges. The law on the subject is well-settled. It is also reiterated recently, referring to all earlier laws by the Apex Court in case of L Krishna Reddy v. State by Station House Officer & Ors., reported in (2014) 14 SCC 401. As could be noticed from the material on record, the birth date of the prosecutrix is 10th September 1999. The marriage according to the prosecution took place with the applicant no.1 herein on 23rd August 2013 when the prosecutrix was only 13 years old. The trial Court has rightly observed that the victim being less than 15 years of age, the provisions of POSCO Act 2012 which are otherwise meant for protecting the abuse of the children have been rightly invoked, even if the parents were agreeable to such marriage, the law will take its own course. Moreover, addition of Sections 4 & 17 is merely incidental as substantive provisions of Sections 3 & 16 were already forming part of the chargesheet. On neither count, this application warrants interference at the hands of this Court. Moreover, there is no grave miscarriage of justice nor there is any manifest illegality which deserves indulgence. Resultantly, Criminal Misc. Application fails and the same is rejected.",
    "Question": "What factors did the Court consider in determining the appropriateness of charges against the accused in the case involving the marriage of the 13-year-old prosecutrix, and how did these factors align with the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act?",
    "A": "The Court considered the age of consent, dismissing charges due to marriage consent.",
    "B": "The Court focused solely on the family's internal dispute and disregarded age laws.",
    "C": "The Court evaluated the prosecutrix's age and its implications under the POCSO Act and decided that charges should be framed based on the law.",
    "D": "The Court's decision was influenced primarily by public opinion rather than legal standards.",
    "Correct Answer": "The Court evaluated the prosecutrix's age and its implications under the POCSO Act and decided that charges should be framed based on the law.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage outlines that the trial Court invoked the provisions of the POSCO Act because the prosecutrix was aged 13 at the time of her marriage. The age of the victim was a crucial factor for the Court in aligning with the legal standards aimed at protecting children from sexual offenses."

    "Reasoning": "The passage outlines that the court considers amicable settlements by victims alongside the principles of protecting child welfare. Even in instances where charges relate to child marriage, the court can quash allegations if it satisfies that doing so aligns with justice and the victim's voluntary decision."

Respondent(s) For Applicants(s) : Shri Akshay Sail, Advocate For Respondent/State : Ms.Pragya Shrivastava, Dy.GA (Hon'ble Shri Justice Arvind Kumar Verma) Order on Board 25/03/2025 As the above three M.Cr.Cs. are arising out of the same Crime Number, they are being disposed of by this common order. 2. The applicants have filed this bail application under Section 483 of the Bhartiya Nagrrik Suraksha Sanhita for grant of regular bail as they are in custody in connection with Crime No. 256/2024 registered at police station Mahasamund, District Mahasamund (CG) for the offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(n), 376(3), 506 Part-II/34 of IPC, Section 6 of the POCSO and Section 67 of the IT Act. 3. Prosecution case in brief is that report was lodged against the applicants on 19.05.2024 alleging that the applicants took the prosecutrix to the doctor on 17.05.2024 as she was complaining of stomach ache and on examination, she was found pregnant. Thereafter on 18.05.2024, she was admitted at Aditya Hospital, Mahasamund for treatment. It is the case of prosecution that the applicant in M.Cr.C. No. 1463/2025 were having love affair and on 21.01.2024 they developed physical relations and the co-accused persons helped the applicant in the said offence. Based on the said report two more Crime Nos. were registered against two different persons namely Rajendra Sahu and Tulsi Sahu (Cr. Nos. 257/2024 and 258/2024) respectively. On the basis of the said report, the police registered the offence against the accused persons and they were arrested. 4. Counsel for the applicants submits that the applicants have been falsely implicated in the case. He further contended that the FIR was lodged with a delay of about 5 months. It is contended that the incident took place on 19.01.2024 and 21.01.2024 whereas the FIR was lodged on 19.05.2024. It is contended that two more FIRs have been registered against two others of the same offence of sexual assault and therefore the testimony of the prosecutrix not credible and creates doubt as she has narrated different stories in her statements. It is submitted that the accused Rajendra Sahu in Crime No. 257/2024 has been granted bail by this Court in M.Cr.C. No. 6869/2024 vide order dated 08.01.2025, therefore the present applicants may also be granted similar benefit. 5. It is contended on behalf of the applicants namely, Ashik Nishad and Ganesh Nishad in M.Cr.C. Nos. 1464/2025 and 1467/2025 receptively that they have only assisted the applicant Guman Nishad in the commission of rape. Lastly, it is submitted that the charge sheet has been filed, they are in jail since 20.05.2024 and the trial is likely to take some time, they are ready and willing to comply with any of the conditions which may be imposed upon them and thus, it is submitted that the application be allowed and the applicants be released on bail. 6. Learned counsel for the respondent/State, on the other hand, has opposed the bail applications and submits that applicant Ashik Nishad in M.Cr.C. No1464/2025 had transmitted in the electronic form and made it viral. 7. Heard counsel for the parties and perused the record. 8. From perusal of the prosecution case, the accused Guman Nishad had developed physical relation with the victim, she became pregnant and thereafter when her parents came to know about the incident, the report was lodged. However, after the victim gave birth to a child and DNA test was done and as per the report, applicant was not the biological father of the child. 9. Here in the present case, though the applicant had denied to have made any physical relation with the prosecutrix but considering the fact that it was not the first occasion when the complaint was made by the prosecutrix for committing rape but in the same vein she made similar type of allegations against other persons also. Thus, taking into consideration the fact that they are in jail since 20.05.2024, charge sheet has been filed and that the final disposal of the trial is likely to take sufficiently long time, the present applications deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, their bail applications are allowed. 10. It is directed that in the event of applicants' executing a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 10,000/- each with one surety to the satisfaction of the concerned trial court, they shall be released on bail on the following conditions: I) they shall file an undertaking to the effect that he/she shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in the Court. IN case of default of this condition, it shall be open for the trial court to treat it as abuse of liberty of bail and pass orders in accordance with law. ii) they shall remain present before the trial court on each date fixed, either personally or through his/her counsel.

In accordance with law under Section 209 of BNS, 2023. iv) The applicants shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on the dates fixed for (i) opening of the case (ii) framing of charge and (iii) recording of statement under Section 351 of BNSS, 2023.If in the opinion of the trial court absence of the applicants are deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him/her in accordance with law.

Appeal No. 67/17 FIR No. 351/16 Police Station : Lajpat Nagar Under Section : 302/34 IPC 'S '(CCL), S/o Shri 'G' (Appellant being minor is represented through natural guardian/father, Sh. 'G') ........Appellant.\nVersus\nState/ Govt of NCT .......Non­appellant/respondent\nO R D E R 1. Vide this order I shall decide the appeal filed on behalf of the appellant/CCL 'S' through his father against the order dated 13.01.2017 passed by the Ld. Juvenile Justice Board­II Delhi wherein the Ld. JJB has directed that medical opinion with regard to the age of the CCL/appellant be obtained by a duly constituted medical board at Safdarjung Hospital. 2. The appellant/CCL was apprehended by the police during the investigation of FIR No. 351/16, PS Lajpat Nagar which was initially registered U/s 307/34 IPC but subsequently due to death of the victim, Section 302 IPC was also added in the said case. 3. The appellant/CCL claimed juvenility and consequently age determination inquiry was conducted by the Ld. JJB­II. During the course of said inquiry it has come on record that after his apprehension the appellant/CCL had furnished his school documents in the nature of Scholar's register and transfer certificate Form purportedly issued from Chaudhary Beerpal Singh Inter College, Barah Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh. However the said document was found to be forged upon verification and subsequently yet another school record in the nature of school leaving certificate purportedly issued by Principal, Dhani Ram Sharma Public School, Makanpur Khadar, Post Dankaur District, Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh was filed alongwith bail application of appellant/CCL. In the age determination inquiry, the Ld. Board has examined CW­1, Principal of the said school and CW­2, Shri Harjit Panwar, Head Clerk, Transport Authority, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi. The Ld. JJB also examined the appellant/CCL under section 165 Evidence Act wherein the CCL claimed that he had taken admission in Chaudhary Beerpal Singh Inter College, Barah Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh but he did not attend any classes. He was also examined in order to ascertain the documents on the basis of which he had set up his date of birth of 08.09.1992 before the Transport Authority at Delhi for procuring his driving licence but the Ld. Counsel for the CCL has contended that the said driving licence was procured through a tout/middle man. The Juvenile Justice Board placed reliance on the judgments titled, 'Om Prakash Vs. State of Rajasthan & Anr.','Parag Bhati Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.' and other judgment titled 'Mukarrab Vs. State of UP' to hold that the plea of minority set up by the CCL is not free from ambiguity and doubts. The JJB directed for obtaining the medical opinion based on scientific investigations as regards age of CCL. 4. The Ld. counsel for appellant has vehemently argued that once the Juvenile Justice Board had examined CW­1, Principal of Dhani Ram Sharma Public School, Uttar Pradesh then there was no occasion for the JJB to order for constitution of medical board for seeking medical opinion in respect of the age of the appellant. 5. The Hon'ble Apex Court in 'Om Prakash vs. State of Rajasthan (Supra)' has decided about the approach to be adopted in age enquiry in grave and heinous offences and held that if there is a clear and unambiguous case in favour of the juvenile accused that he was a minor below the age of 18 years on the date of the incident, he would be entitled for this special protection under the Juvenile Justice Act. But when an accused commits a grave and heinous offence and attempts to take statutory shelter under the guise of being a minor, a casual or cavalier approach, cannot be permitted as the courts are enjoined upon to perform their duties with the object of protecting the confidence of common man in the institution entrusted with the administration of justice. 6. Thus in a circumstance where the Ld JJB cannot arrive at a conclusive finding regarding the age of the accused, the opinion of the medical experts based on x­ray and ossification test can be obtained. 7. The benefit of the principle of benevolent legislation attached to Juvenile Justice Act would thus apply to only such cases wherein the accused is held to be a juvenile based on cogent evidence regarding his minority. 8. In view of the above discussions, the impugned order of the Ld. JJB for obtaining the medical opinion can not be faulted by appellant/CCL who gives forged and fabricated school documents regarding his age initially and also uses documents showing his majority for obtaining Driving Licence from Transport authority/Govt Dept but hides the said documents when involved in case of heinous nature.",
    "Question": "How does the reliance on fraudulent school documents influence the judicial process of determining an accused's juvenile status? Elaborate on the legal rationale that supports strict scrutiny in such cases involving severe allegations.",
    "A": "The judicial process is unaffected by the quality of documents if the accused claims minority.",
    "B": "The court must question the reliability of all documents when juvenility is claimed, especially if doubts arise.",
    "C": "Forgery in documents is inconsequential as the claims take precedence over evidence.",
    "D": "All claims by the accused must be accepted to uphold the juvenile justice system.",
    "Correct Answer": "The court must question the reliability of all documents when juvenility is claimed, especially if doubts arise.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage indicates that presenting forged documents to substantiate a claim of minority not only undermines the credibility of the accused but also necessitates a deeper judicial examination to maintain the integrity of the juvenile justice system. The established legal rationale is that the court has a duty to ensure that protections under juvenile law are not exploited, leading to stringent evaluations of evidence provided."

The appellant filed this appeal questioning the conviction recorded under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code and sentenced to undergo seven years simple imprisonment. However, the appellant was acquitted for the charges under Sections 354-A, 366-A of Indian Penal Code and Section 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO' Act). 2. Briefly stated, the case of the prosecution is that PW1 who is brother of the victim PW4 filed complaint Ex.P1 with the police stating that PW4 was missing and he suspected the appellant herein. According to prosecution case, the appellant took PW4 to a temple and tied gold 'pustela thadu' (sacred thread) around the neck of bride during marriage ceremony. Thereafter, PW4 and the appellant stayed at different places and nearly after ten days, the accused and PW4 were caught by the police. Thereafter, statement of PW4 was recorded by the Magistrate and the police. As per the statement given to the police and Magistrate under under section 164 CRPC marked as Ex.P4, PW4 stated that she was in love with the appellant and decided to marry him and went with the appellant on her own, taking one gold biscuit weighing six tulas. She told the appellant that they should elope and get married, accordingly, they went to Karimnagar in an auto and boarded a bus for Secunderabad and from Secunderabad they went to Thirupathi. Thereafter, they were caught by the police. On completion of investigation, the police filed charge sheet under Sections 366-A, 354 of Indian Penal Code and Section 12 of the POCSO Act, 2012. After the trial, the learned Sessions Judge found the appellant not guilty for the said charges, however, convicted the appellant under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code. 3. It is the specific case of PW4-victim that she was in love with the appellant and on her own she went with the appellant to Karimnagar and to Thirupathi where they got married and came back to Secunderabad. Neither in the statement made before the Court nor the statement made before the Magistrate under Ex.P4, did PW4 make any allegation of force against the appellant. Further, she stated during the chief-examination that accused did not make any sexual assault on her. 4. The learned Sessions Judge found that the girl was not a minor and the provisions of Section of POCSO Act did not attract. The trial Court also found that there was no allegation of any molestation for which reason, the trial Court found the appellant not guilty for the said offences. 5. Section 366 of Indian Penal Code reads as follows: \"366. Kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc.--Whoever kidnaps or abducts any woman with intent that she may be compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled, to marry any person against her will, or in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, or knowing it to be likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; 1 [and whoever, by means of criminal intimidation as defined in this Code or of abuse of authority or any other method of compulsion, induces any woman to go from any place with intent that she may be, or knowing that it is likely that she will be, forced or seduced to illicit intercourse with another person shall also be punishable as aforesaid].\" 6. Question of kidnapping or abducting does not arise when the evidence itself discloses that PW4 had taken six tulas of gold and asked the appellant to come along with him and on her own they went to Thirupathi and came back. There is not even a whisper for any kind of force or compulsion under which PW4 went along with the appellant for all the 15 days. 7. Having found that PW4 was not a child, having acquitted the appellant for the offences under POCSO Act and also having found that there was no outraging of modesty of victim girl, the trial Court ought to have acquitted the appellant. 8. As seen from the evidence none of the ingredients of Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code are made out and for the said reason, the appellant is liable to be acquitted of the charge under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code and accordingly, acquitted. The appeal is allowed setting aside the conviction of the appellant under Section 366 of IPC. Since the appellant is already on bail, the bail bonds shall stand cancelled. As a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending, shall stands closed.",

The FIR in question was registered on the complaint of Raju Yadav, the father of the victim girl, who in his complaint has alleged that on 23.08.2015 at 6.00 PM, accused Fareem Beg along with his two associates namely Naim and Sehzad misbehaved with his victim daughter, abused her and gesturing with her and when he objected to the same, he was threatened by accused and his associates. On the said complaint of the father of the victim, the present FIR was registered u/s 506/509 of IPC and section 12 of POCSO Act on 24.08.2015 and the investigation was commenced. 3. During course of investigation, counseling of victim girl was conducted by NGO Mehar Charitable Society through DCW and her statement under section 161 of Cr.P.C. was recorded and site plan of place of occurrence was prepared at the instance of complainant Raju Yadav. Statement of the victim under section 164 of Cr.P.C. was also got recorded. During further investigation, date of birth proof of the victim girl was collected and accused Fareem Beg was arrested on 13.10.2015 and was sent to judicial custody. However, subsequently he was granted bail by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi vide order dated 27.04.2016. Another accused Shezad had joined the investigation but no sufficient evidence against him was found and therefore IO kept his name in column No. 12 of the charge­sheet. The co­accused namely Faim @ Naim who is brother of accused Fareem Beg was evading and he is at large. NBWs against him were taken. On the basis of the statement of the victim girl recorded under section 164 of Cr.P.C, section 506/509 IPC and Section 12 of POCSO Act were added and challan was prepared under sections 354/506/509/34 of IPC and section 8 & 12 of POCSO Act and put up before the court on 11.12.2015 for trial against the accused Fareem Beg. 4. On 29.02.2016, after hearing the Ld. Defence Counsel for the accused Fareem Beg and the Ld. Special Public Prosecution, Charge for the offences punishable under sections 354 of IPC and. 5. The victim and the complainant, who is also father of the victim on whose complaint the present FIR got registered against the accused Fareem Beg, are the star and material witnesses of the prosecution, who could have proved the allegations levelled against the accused. But the prosecution has miserably failed to examine both the witnesses despite availing sufficient opportunities. The prosecution even could not trace out the victim and her father and they could not be served despite best efforts made by the prosecution. The victim girl though in her statement recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C. stated that she was playing at 6'O clock in the evening and at that time Naim, Fareem (accused in the present case) and Shejzaad came there. Naim caught her, Fareem caught and kissed her and put his both the hands in her panty and tried to open her pajama. She shouted loudly then her father came and they all fled away. She further sated that Fareem and Naim came to her father later and threatened him if he would make any complaint in this regard, they would kill her father. But the victim girl did not appear in the witness box to prove all these allegations. In the absence of testimony of victim and her father, no incriminating evidence has come on record against the accused. There is no other eyewitness to the incident. Rest of the witnesses are formal i.e. the counselor who counseled the victim, the principal to prove the age of the victim, DO to prove the registration of FIR, IO and the Ld. MM who recorded the statement of victim u/s 164 Cr.P.C. Hence, it will be a futile exercise to examine rest of the witnesses in this case, as none of them is an eyewitness to the incident. Continuing with this trial any further, will only result in wastage of time and resources, and there will be no impact on the result of this trial. Hence, the prosecution evidence is closed and the SA of the accused is dispensed with. 6. In the overall facts and circumstances of the case, there being no material or incriminating evidence against the accused Fareem Beg, he cannot be said to be guilty of committing the offences as charged against him and he is entitled to be acquitted. Accordingly, Accused Fareem Beg is acquitted of the offences punishable under sections 354 of IPC and section 10 of POCSO Act. 7. However, Fareem Beg is required to furnish bail bond under section 437A of Cr.P.C, which shall remain in force for a period of six months. 8. File be consigned to Record Room, after due compliance of provisions of section 437A of Cr.P.C. by Fareem Beg. Pronounced in the open Court (Balwant Rai Bansal) on 30th of May, 2017.

The prosecution case is that the complainant, Sandhya Suryawanshi, reported that on 17/05/2015, the appellant took her daughter behind a temple and kissed her, showing his private part. However, the FIR was registered 4 days later due to fear of defamation. The appellant argued that the delay was fatal to the prosecution case. Nonetheless, the prosecution maintained that the complainant's fear was valid in such cases involving minors. The Court also noted that such delays are not unusual due to societal stigma attached to sexual offences. Ultimately, the Court found that the delay raised doubts about the prosecution’s case and acquitted the appellant, citing lack of strong evidence and suggesting that he was falsely implicated due to a familial dispute.",

    "Passage": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF GUJARAT AT AHMEDABAD R/CRIMINAL MISC.APPLICATION NO. 10266 of 2021 PRAKASHBHAI GORDHANBHAI METAL (KODI PATEL) Versus STATE OF GUJARAT Appearance: A R KADRI(7330) for the Applicant(s) No. 1 MR PRANAV TRIVEDI APP(2) for the Respondent(s) No. 1 CORAM:HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S.H.VORA Date : 22/06/2021 ORAL ORDER Rule. Learned APP waives service of notice of rule for the respondent - State. 1. Heard learned advocate for the applicant and learned APP for the respondent State. 2. This application is filed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for regular bail in connection with F.I.R. registered at C.R. No.11215029200377 of 2020 with Tarapur Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 363, 366 and 376 of the IPC and u/s 4, 6 and 18 of the POCSO Act. 3. Learned advocate for the applicant has submitted that the applicant and the prosecutrix were in love with each other and the prosecutrix accompanied the applicant of her own and thereby, abandoned the guardianship of her parents voluntarily. 4. Learned APP, while opposing the application, has submitted that at the relevant time, the prosecutrix was aged 17 years and 07 months. She being the minor, the question of consent does not arise and therefore, the offence u/s 376 read with POCSO Act has been committed and therefore, the applicant may not be enlarged on bail. 5. Heard learned advocates appearing for the respective parties in great detail and perused the records. 6. Though the applicant is married having one child fell in love with the victim girl. As the prosecutrix was minor, the applicant is sent behind prison because of the complaint lodged by the complainant. Undoubtedly, a minor girl is to be protected under law as there are number of instances of sexual abuses of minor girls and therefore, there is a special legislation of POCSO in the year 2012 and amendment in sections 375 and 376 of the IPC in 2014. The judiciary takes a very serious note of sexual offences against women and specially against minor girls. Upon reading of the statement of the prosecutrix, they both eloped. Further, the trial Court rejected bail application mainly on the ground that the girl is minor and her consent is immaterial. 7. In the present case, the prosecutrix is 17 years and 07 months old and the accused is 21 years old. It appears from the record and the statement of the prosecutrix that the prosecutrix was in love with the applicant and left the home of her own and moved with the applicant at various places. These are the mitigating factors and therefore, present application deserves consideration. 8. Hence, the application is allowed and the applicant is ordered to be released on bail in connection with C.R. No.11215029200377 of 2020 with Tarapur Police Station, on executing a bond of Rs.10,000/-(Rupees Ten Thousand only) with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court and subject to the conditions that the applicant shall; [a] not take undue advantage of liberty or misuse liberty; [b] not act in a manner injurious to the interest of the prosecution; [c] not leave the territory of India without prior permission of the Sessions Judge concerned; [d] appear before the Investigation Officer concerned, as and when required for investigation purpose and attend the Court concerned regularly.

    "Passage": "This application is filed under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C. The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No. 1046/2018 of the Poonthura Police Station, registered under Section 11(IV) r/w Sec.12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, Section 376(2)(f) of the IPC and Section 3(a) r/w Sections 4 and 5 (n) r/w Sec.6 of the POCSO. The survivor is a 15 year old child. The applicant herein is the husband of her aunt. According to the survivor child, the applicant had subjected her to sexual abuse while she was in the VIII standard. She went on to state that in the month of July, 2016, the applicant subjected her to penetrative sexual abuse. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that the applicant had accommodated the survivor and her sister when her mother had gone to Singapore for work. He had maintained the children for years and it was only in the month of March, 2018 that the children had left his house and had joined their grand mother. In the initial statement given to the Police, there was no allegation that he had subjected the child to penetrative sexual intercourse. It was contended by the learned counsel that the applicant is innocent and he was roped in without a just cause. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the allegations are grave. The child did not disclose the entire facts initially as the wife of the applicant was also with her. In her 164 statement before the learned Magistrate, the child had stated in detail the gross sexual abuse that she was subjected to by the applicant herein. I have considered the submissions advanced by both sides and have gone through the 164 statement. Prima facie, it appears that there are convincing materials which point to the involvement of the applicant. In that view of the matter, this Court will not be justified in granting an order of pre-arrest bail to the applicant. I direct the applicant to surrender before the Investigating Officer or the court having jurisdiction and seek regular bail. If an application for bail is filed, the same shall be considered and orders shall be passed expeditiously and on its merits. This application is dismissed.",
    "Question": "What protections are afforded to the survivor child under the law based on the details provided in the case? Which provisions from the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act should be relevant in seeking justice for her?",
    "A": "The child is protected by the laws of family care and should stay with relatives.",
    "B": "She is protected under the laws against harassment and can file a complaint.",
    "C": "The provisions regarding definition and punishment for penetrative sexual assault provide her protection and enable legal proceeding to halt the accused.",
    "D": "There are no specific protections available for children under the current law.",
    "Correct Answer": "The provisions regarding definition and punishment for penetrative sexual assault provide her protection and enable legal proceeding to halt the accused.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage explicitly refers to the application of the POCSO Act, which defines and punishes various forms of sexual violence against children, including penetrative sexual assault. Thus, these provisions not only protect the survivor but also provide a framework for legal redress against the accused."

Mr.Neeraj Poswal, AAG, Haryana. H.S. MADAAN, J. This petition for regular bail has been filed by petitioner - Sanjay alias Machhi- an accused in FIR No.459 dated 17.5.2018, under Sections 341, 354-A, 354-D, 506 IPC (Section 8 of POCSO Act added later on), registered with Police Station Chandni Bagh, District Panipat. Briefly stated, the facts of the case, as per the prosecution story, are that the complainant(name not being mentioned to conceal her identity and referred to as 'the victim') daughter of Dharamvir, resident of Shashtri Colony, Panipat, a student of 10th class in R.S. High School, Panipat had lodged the FIR in question by submitting a written complaint to Incharge, Police Post Kishanpura, Panipat. Inter alia in the complaint, she submitted that when she used to go to school then accused Sanjay alias Machhi son of Shobh Raj, resident of their locality used to follow her and passed obscene remarks; that on 15.5.2018 while she was going in the street then Sanjay alias Machhi intercepted her catching hold of her hand and indulged in teasing her, threatening her that if she disclosed the incident to anyone, then he would kill her. Accused was arrested in this case on 17.5.2018. After completion of investigation, he has been challaned and now the case is pending trial. He had filed an application for regular bail in the Court of Sessions, which was declined by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Panipat vide order dated 3.7.2018, as such, he has approached this Court with the same request. Notice of the petition was given to respondent - State and counsel representing the State has put in appearance. I have heard learned counsel for the parties besides going through the record. After hearing the rival contentions of learned counsel for the parties, I find that the incidents of child abuse and molestation of young girls are increasing day by day. It is not safe for the womenfolk to venture out of their houses even. A serious law and order problem in that regard is fast emerging. In case precautionary measures are not taken at the initial stage, the things may get out of hand and would be very difficult to control. The persons harassing molesting and sexually abusing young girls need to be dealt with an iron hand and no leniency can be shown to them. The petitioner has indulged in teasing a minor girl of his own locality catching hold of her hand with intent to outrage her modesty and gave beatings to her. He also threatened to kill her brothers. The trial against the petitioner is going on. The statement of victim/prosecutrix is yet to be recorded. The guilt of the accused shall be determined during the trial.

The first case, registered under Crime No.2/2023, alleges that Sudheeran disclosed the identity of the victim in Crime No.2113/2016 on May 28, 2022. The second case, registered under Crime No.516/2023, involves similar allegations but regarding incidents on March 11 and 23, 2023. The accused has sought to quash both cases on the grounds that they arise from the same event, arguing that the prosecution is abusing the process of law by registering multiple FIRs for the same offence. The court examined arguments from both sides regarding the legitimacy of pursuing charges in multiple FIRs for allegations that, according to the defense, should be treated as a single incident. It was determined that the cases involve distinct actions that occurred at different times, hence they are not duplicative but rather different offenses that warrant separate legal proceedings, ultimately leading to the dismissal of the quashment requests.",

    "B": "The lack of corroborative evidence undermines the victim's testimony, leading to the possibility of acquittal in cases like Mohit's.",
    "C": "Corroborative evidence only matters if the accused is found guilty.",
    "D": "All cases are automatically presumed guilt without the need for corroborative evidence.",

Quashing the case based on these events has raised concerns regarding future child protection enforcement.",
    "Question": "With the court's decision to quash the case based on resolved family matters and marriage, what does this indicate about the priorities of child protection laws in addressing the rights of minors versus familial reconciliations in cases of abuse?",

    "B": "It shows that the courts are committed to strict enforcement of child protection laws.",

    "Passage": "G.Pappuraj vs The Chairman on 4 January, 2018. Before the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court. This Writ Petition is filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, to issue a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus, calling for the records pertaining to the impugned notice issued by the 3rd respondent in his proceedings in Na.Ka.No.A3/12750/2017 dated 09.10.2017 and quash the same and consequently direct the respondents to appoint the petitioner in the post of Police Constable Grade II - 2017. The Chairman, Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board, Chennai ? 2, issued notification dated 23.01.2017 inviting applications for the post of Police Constables ? Grade II, Jail Warders ? Grade II and Fireman, 2017. The petitioner herein was eligible to apply for the said post. He submitted his application dated 05.02.2017. He was issued with the hall ticket. He took part in the selection process and was found to be successful. But, he was denied appointment on the ground that his character and antecedent were not found to be satisfactory. The third respondent issued the impugned memorandum dated 09.10.2017 in this regard. The learned Additional Advocate General drew the attention of this Court to the serious allegations made against the writ petitioner. He was implicated not in a petty criminal case, but a serious one. It was a case involving Section 4 of POCSO Act, 2012. The victim child had narrated the sexual abuse and torture to which he was subjected to. However, before the criminal Court, the prosecution witnesses turned hostile. It is obvious that in view of Ex.P7 marked in the said judgment, the acquittal rendered in favour of the writ petitioner cannot be said to be honourable. In all probability, the parents of the victim child were won over by the accused. A Full Bench of this Court held that by virtue of Explanation 1 to clause (iv) of Rule 14(b) of the Tamil Nadu Special Police Subordinate Service Rules, a person acquitted on benefit of doubt or discharged in a criminal case, can still be considered as disqualified for selection to the police service of the State. Considering the serious nature of the case, in which the writ petitioner was involved and the fact that the victim had given a statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C., I am of the view that no indulgence deserves to be shown to the writ petitioner. The order impugned in the writ petition is sustained. This writ petition stands dismissed.",
    "Question": "In light of the passage regarding G.Pappuraj's legal case, what legal repercussions could arise if a person involved in a severe crime, particularly under the POCSO Act, seeks to join the police service without disclosing their criminal history?",
    "A": "The individual will likely be granted immediate acceptance into the police service despite their history.",
    "B": "The appointing authority is obliged to overlook past criminal involvement if the charges resulted in acquittal.",
    "C": "The individual could face disqualification for not disclosing the criminal case, regardless of acquittal.",
    "D": "The police service will assess the individual's suitability completely ignoring their past allegations.",
    "Correct Answer": "The individual could face disqualification for not disclosing the criminal case, regardless of acquittal.",
    "Reasoning": "According to the passage, the rules stipulate that non-disclosure of involvement in any criminal case can lead to disqualification from joining the police service. Hence, even if the individual was acquitted, their failure to disclose the previous allegations is grounds for rejection."

The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No. 1046/2018 of the Poonthura Police Station, registered under Section 11(IV) r/w Sec.12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, Section 376(2)(f) of the IPC and Section 3(a) r/w Sections 4 and 5 (n) r/w Sec.6 of the POCSO. The survivor is a 15 year old child. The applicant herein is the husband of her aunt. According to the survivor child, the applicant had subjected her to sexual abuse while she was in the VIII standard. She went on to state that in the month of July, 2016, the applicant subjected her to penetrative sexual abuse. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that the applicant had accommodated the survivor and her sister when her mother had gone to Singapore for work. He had maintained the children for years and it was only in the month of March, 2018 that the children had left his house and had joined their grand mother. In the initial statement given to the Police, there was no allegation that he had subjected the child to penetrative sexual intercourse. It was contended by the learned counsel that the applicant is innocent and he was roped in without a just cause. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the allegations are grave. The child did not disclose the entire facts initially as the wife of the applicant was also with her. In her 164 statement before the learned Magistrate, the child had stated in detail the gross sexual abuse that she was subjected to by the applicant herein. I have considered the submissions advanced by both sides and have gone through the 164 statement. Prima facie, it appears that there are convincing materials which point to the involvement of the applicant. In that view of the matter, this Court will not be justified in granting an order of pre-arrest bail to the applicant. I direct the applicant to surrender before the Investigating Officer or the court having jurisdiction and seek regular bail. If an application for bail is filed, the same shall be considered and orders shall be passed expeditiously and on its merits. This application is dismissed.",

    "Reasoning": "The passage refers directly to the POCSO Act which is designed to protect children from sexual offences. Effective implementation of these provisions through proper legal channels and support services is vital for ensuring the survivor receives justice and emotional support."

On enquiry, the complainant came to know that the petitioner had abducted the victim girl without the permission of the guardian. The said information was given by none other than the brother of the petitioner and he assured the complainant not to lodge any complaint so that he will bring back the said girl. During the course of the investigation, the police have recorded the statement of the victim girl on 09.01.2016 wherein she has stated that the petitioner has persuaded her on the ground that her father always used to abuse her, he would look after her with all love and affection and that they can live happily together. On that persuasion, the said girl aged 14 years was kidnapped by him. In her statement she has stated that the petitioner had sexual intercourse with her and also threatened her with dire consequences that, if she disclose the same to anybody, he would kill her. Thereafter, he took her to his village in Uttar Pradesh and they stayed there for 15 days and, thereafter, it appears she was brought back to her house. Looking to the above said facts and circumstances, whether there was any sexual intercourse or not has to be considered by the Court. However the statement of the victim girl made before the police is very much available which is consistent with the statement given under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. with regard to kidnapping the victim girl aged 14 years. I can understand, about the consent, if the girl is on the verge of attaining the age of majority who knows the pros and cons of the act. But, here, the said girl is aged 14 years. The persuasion is apparent on the face of the record. If such situations are allowed to be continued, there would be no safety or security to the girl child in our country. Under the above said circumstances, I am of the opinion that the petitioner, at this stage, is not entitled to be enlarged on bail. The petition deserves to be dismissed. However, since the accused is in judicial custody for more than one year, the Trial Court is hereby directed to expedite the trial and dispose of the matter within six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.",

Submission of the learned counsel for the applicant is that informant side is tenant in the building of applicant and when he went there to demand rent, he has been falsely implicated in this case. Further submission is that he is teacher by profession and due to the F.I.R. police is inclined to make arrest, therefore, a prima facie case for anticipatory bail is made out. It is further submitted that applicant has no criminal history and applicant is prepared to furnish sureties and bonds, there is no possibility of his either fleeing away from the judicial process or tampering with the evidence. Learned A.G.A. has vehemently opposed the prayer of bail and has submitted that offence also pertains to POCSO Act and the victim child has given statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. supporting the F.I.R. version and has stated that applicant sexually abused her, therefore, no prima facie case has been made out for the anticipatory bail. In view of above and also that the case pertains to POCSO Act and the law has been enacted in order to prevent sexual abuse of the children, if in such kind of cases anticipatory bail is granted, this will frustrate the very object of law.

List has been revised.\n2. Heard Sri Rajiv Kumar Tripathi, learned counsel for the applicant as well as Sri Sunil Kumar, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.\n3. Applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No.39 of 2024, under Sections 498-A, 304-B, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station- Kailiya, District- Jalaun, during the pendency of trial. \n\nPROSECUTION STORY:\n4. The marriage of the applicant was solemnized with the daughter of the informant as per Hindu Rites on 12.5.2018. The applicant and other family members are stated to have subjected her to cruelty for demand of a motorcycle as dowry, thereby, leading her to death on 26.6.2024.\n\nARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT:\n5. The applicant is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case.\n6. The FIR is delayed by about one day and there is no explanation of the said delay caused. No time of offence is mentioned in the FIR.\n7. The informant herein is Panch witness no.1 in the inquest proceedings, which was undertaken on the information given by the brother of the applicant to the police. The inquest report was already complete on 26.6.2024 at 08:45 p.m. \n8. The victim was depressed as she could not bear any child and the applicant had dark complexion. \n9. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length. \n10. There is no criminal history of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 6.7.2024 and is ready to cooperate with trial. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail. \n\nARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF STATE/OPPOSITE PARTY:\n11. The bail application has been opposed but the submissions raised by the learned counsel for the applicant could not be disputed. \n\nCONCLUSION: \n12. In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and another vs Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others AIR 1980 SC 785, this Court has avoided detailed examination of the evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case as no party should have the impression that his case has been prejudiced. A prima facie satisfaction of case is needed but it is not the same as an exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself.\n\n13. The well-known principle of \"Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty\" gives rise to the concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception. \n14. A person's right to life and liberty, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, cannot be taken away simply because the person is accused of committing an offence until the guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life or personal liberty may be taken away unless the procedure established by law is followed, and the procedure must be just and reasonable. The said principle has been recapitulated by the Supreme Court in Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors., 2022 INSC 690.\n15. Reiterating the aforesaid view the Supreme Court in the case of Manish Sisodia Vs. Directorate of Enforcement 2024 INSC 595 has again emphasised that the very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment is not to be forgotten. It is high time that the Courts should recognize the principle that bail is a rule and jail is an exception?.\n16. Learned AGA could not bring forth any exceptional circumstances which would warrant denial of bail to the applicant.\n17. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the trial. No material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like have been shown by learned AGA.\n18. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed.\n19. Let the applicant- Dilip involved in aforementioned case crime number be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to following conditions.\n(i) The applicant shall not tamper with evidence.\n(ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C./351 B.N.S.S. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law.\n20. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. Identity, status and residence proof of the applicant and sureties be verified by the court concerned before the bonds are accepted.\n21. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses.\nOrder Date :- 10.1.2025/ Vikas\n\n(Justice Krishan Pahal)",

She has expressed her willingness to go alongwith mother and she is not at all willing to go alongwith her father. In the order dated 08.10.2021 we have thoroughly discussed as to how the petitioner-natural mother of minor daughter Juhi @ Tanishka had to run from pillar to post for getting interim custody of her minor daughter Juhi @ Tanishka in the backdrop of registration of crime against father of Juhi @ Tanishka. So far as the health issue of minor girl Juhi @ Tanishka is concerned, in terms of order dated 08.10.2021, she was referred to the hospital name and style as Varad Medical Foundation Institute of Child Health, Aurangabad. Dr. S.M. Khandelwal has examined the girl and certified that she is in normal state of health at present. The said doctor has also opined that the girl needs to continue her antiepileptic drugs as advice. A report to that effect is submitted by the Superintendent of Vidhyadeep Anathalay/ Balgruha, Chawni, Aurangabad alongwith medical fitness certificate issued by Dr. S.M. Khandelwal. Even the Chairman of Child Welfare Committee, Aurangabad has submitted certain papers. However, the same may not be relevant for the present discussion and for the cause referred in the writ petition.

In the circumstances, it would be just and appropriate if the interim custody of minor child Juhi @ Tanishka Rahul Wadhave is given to the petitioner forthwith. Since the petition No. D-004 of 2015 is still pending before the Family Court at Aurangabad, the parties are at liberty to make appropriate submissions and it is for the learned Judge of the Family Court to pass final order keeping in mind the registration of crime against the father of the child so also after giving an opportunity of being heard to both the parties.

Child sexual abuse (hereinafter called \"CSA\") has been interpreted by the World Health Organisation (hereinafter called \"WHO\") as the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or for which the child is not developmentally prepared and cannot give consent. The impact of the sexual offence is rightly pointed out in Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Subhra Chakraborty, wherein the Supreme Court reiterated that rape is not only a crime against the person of a woman (victim), it is a crime against the entire society. Owing to various emotional, social, and cultural factors, CSA survivors may not be able to express their feelings and experiences. The Law Commission’s 154th Report on reforms in criminal procedure discussed concerns related to ‘victimology’. The criminal claims the survivor’s life, if not physically then affecting their mental and emotional state. Therefore, the courts must consider the gravity of the violation and the circumstances of each case, including the severe mental trauma experienced. The passage also specifies that the compensation awarded is to be based on several factors including immediate rehabilitation needs, severity of abuse, and loss of educational opportunities. This judgment is essential for lifting the veil on the severely undercompensated nature of child sexual abuse cases.",

The prosecution alleges that the petitioners-accused, fully aware that the daughter of petitioner No.2 (accused No.2) was a minor at the time of the incident, solemnized her marriage with accused No.1, and thereafter, accused No.1 committed forcible sexual intercourse with her. As a result of this wedlock, a girl child was born. The petitioners-accused and the survivor are present before this Court and have filed a joint affidavit stating that the marriage of the daughter of accused No.2--alleged to be a minor--was solemnized with accused No.1 due to inadvertence and ignorance of the law. The affidavit further states that from the said wedlock, a girl child was born who is approximately six months old as of today, and that if the petitioners-accused are subjected to trial, it would result in their incarceration, thereby causing additional agony and misery. It is also stated that the survivor and her child are solely dependent on the petitioners-accused for their daily needs. Although the offences are cognizable and non-compoundable, considering that the survivor is approximately 19 years and 4 months old as of today and that a baby girl was born from the wedlock between accused No.1 and the survivor, subjecting the petitioners-accused to trial would result in their incarceration, thereby causing further misery and agony to the survivor and the child rather than serving the ends of justice. Moreover, the petitioners-accused are illiterate, and the marriage was performed due to ignorance of the law. Under these circumstances, the continuation of criminal proceedings would constitute an abuse of the process of law. Accordingly, the petition is allowed.",

PW-4 (Manju), victim's mother corroborated her version in its entirety without any major variation. The statement of 'Y' (assumed name), victim's sister, was recorded as CW-1. In her statement 'Y' too deposed that the accused had taken her inside his house along with her sister 'X'; had shown her nude photos on his mobile; had disrobed her sister 'X'; and, had put off his underwear. In the cross-examination, she denied if she had given statement at the behest of her parents.\n6. On scanning the testimonies of all these witnesses, it stands established that they are consistent throughout and despite cross-examination, nothing material could be extracted to disbelieve them. The witnesses had no ulterior motive to falsely implicate the accused for the heinous offence. They have corroborated each other without any inconsistencies and infirmities. The incident was reported without delay and the appellant was named to be the perpetrator of the crime. Specific and defined role was assigned to him. The accused taking advantage of the loneliness of the small children in the house had dared to outrage their modesty. It has come on record that victim's father Sunil was confined in Tihar Jail in a decoity case. Her mother used to go at her place of work during daytime. It gave an opportunity to the appellant living in the neighborhood to exploit the innocence of the children. In the absence of any prior animosity or enmity, the victims and their mother are not expected to falsely implicate the appellant in a case of sexual abuse to bring themselves in disrepute. The defense put up by the accused deserves outright rejection. Nothing has come on record to show if on any particular date `10,000/- were borrowed by victim's father from him or that to avoid the said payment, the accused was falsely implicated in this case. For a trivial issue over return of money, the victim's parents are not expected to use their kids.\n7. The Trial Court has discussed all the relevant aspects and the impugned order based upon fair appraisal of the evidence deserves no intervention. Sentence order is based upon fair reasoning and warrants no interference except that default sentence for non-payment of the fine shall be Simple Imprisonment for two months instead of nine months and fifteen days in all. Other terms and conditions of the sentence order are left undisturbed.\n8. The appeal stands disposed of in the above terms. Trial Court record along with the copy of the order be sent back forthwith. Intimation be sent to Superintendent Jail.",

Shahpuri, Advocate\n            for the complainant.\n                            ****\n\nH.S. MADAAN, J.\n\n            This petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C. for pre-arrest bail has\nbeen filed by the petitioner - Rakesh Kumar, an accused in FIR No.30\ndated 6.7.2018 under Section 8 of POCSO Act and 216 IPC, registered at\nWomen Police Station, Yamuna Nagar.\n\n            Briefly stated, the facts of the case, as per the prosecution\nstory, are that on 29.12.2017 when the prosecutrix aged about 16 years\nhad gone to her BARA from her house at village Dhaurang, District\nYamuna Nagar, then Rakesh son of Subhash (present petitioner) resident\nof that very village misbehaved with her catching hold of arm of\nprosecutrix. The prosecutrix narrated the entire story to her parents, then\npolice was informed by moving a written application at Women Police\nStation, Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhri.\n              Apprehending his arrest in this case, the petitioner had\napproached the Court of Sessions seeking grant of pre-arrest bail by filing\nan application, however, his such request was declined by learned\nAdditional Sessions Judge (Exclusive Court for Heinous Crimes against\nWomen and Children), Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhri vide order dated\n2.8.2018. As such, the petitioner has approached this Court asking for\nthe same relief.\n              Notice of the petition was given to respondent - State, which\nput in appearance through counsel. The complainant has also appeared\nthrough counsel.\n              I have heard learned counsel for the parties besides going\nthrough the record and I do not find any merit in the present petition.\n              Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that as a matter\nof fact on 29.12.2017, the complainant Subhash Chand and his family\nmembers had attacked family of petitioner causing injuries to them and on\nthat very day, Smt.Parveena wife of Mahinder Kumar had submitted a\ncomplaint to SHO, Police Station Sadar, Yamuna Nagar regarding the\nincident on which DDR No.7 dated 30.12.2017 was entered in daily diary\nand the present FIR is just a counter-blast to the complaint dated\n29.12.2017 against family members of the complainant.\n              Whereas, learned State counsel and learned counsel for the\ncomplainant submitted that the incident as per FIR in this case took place\non 29.12.2017. Admittedly, no action has been taken on the alleged\ncomplaint submitted by Smt.Parveena regarding Subhash Chand and his\nfamily allegedly attacking family of the petitioner and causing injuries to\nthem. If the police had found merit in the allegations observing that\ncommission of cognizable offence was disclosed, then FIR would have\nnormally been registered, which was not so done, rather it appears that the\nDDR in question was lodged to create defence in the present FIR as a\npressure tactic and to set up a parallel case.\n             After hearing the rival contentions of learned counsel for the\nparties, I find that the incidents of child abuse and molestation of young\ngirls are increasing day by day. It is not safe for the womenfolk to venture\nout of their houses even. A serious law and order problem in that regard is\nfast emerging. In case precautionary measures are not taken at the initial\nstage, the things may get out of hand and would be very difficult to\ncontrol. The persons harassing molesting and sexually abusing young girls\nneed to be dealt with iron hand and no leniency can be shown to them.\nHere the allegations against the petitioner are quite serious and grave. Pre\narrest bail is a discretionary relief and is to be granted in exceptional cases\nand not in routine. It is meant to save the innocent persons from\nharassment and inconvenience and not to screen the culprits from\ncustodial interrogation.\n             Custodial interrogation of the petitioner is definitely required\nfor complete and effective investigation. In case custodial interrogation of\nthe petitioner is denied to the investigating agency that would leave many\nloose ends and gaps in the investigation affecting the investigation being\ncarried out adversely which is not called for.\n             Thus finding no merit in the petition, the same stands\ndismissed.\n\n5.9.2018                                           (H.S.MADAAN)\nBrij                                                   JUDGE\n\nWhether reasoned/speaking :             Yes/No\n\nWhether reportable              :       Yes/No\n\n",
    "Question": "What implications does the court's dismissal of Rakesh Kumar's pre-arrest bail petition have on the legal proceedings protecting the child victim and ensuring justice in cases of sexual abuse, as depicted in this judgment?",
    "A": "The dismissal indicates the court's support for pre-arrest bail, suitable in all cases.",
    "B": "It suggests that judicial systems may take strong measures against sexual abuse claims, potentially hindering the victim's case.",
    "C": "The dismissal reflects a commitment to the victim's protection, allowing necessary investigative actions to occur.",
    "D": "It emphasizes the need for leniency towards accused individuals in child abuse cases.",
    "Correct Answer": "The dismissal reflects a commitment to the victim's protection, allowing necessary investigative actions to occur.",
    "Reasoning": "The court's decision indicated that the dismissal of pre-arrest bail was not just a procedural move but a firm stance on prioritizing the investigation and safety of the child victim in sexual abuse cases."

    "Passage": "Child In Conflict With Law Through His ... vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 23 September, 2023\n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court\nChild In Conflict With Law Through His ... vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 23 September, 2023\nAuthor: Rohit Arya\nBench: Rohit Arya\n1\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\nAT GWALIOR\nCRA No. 10440 of 2023\n(CHILD IN CONFLICT WITH LAW THROUGH HIS GUARDIAN/ FATHER Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA\nPRADESH)\nDated : 23-09-2023\nMs. Ayushi Vyas, learned counsel for the appellant.\nMr. N.S. Tomar, learned Public Prosecutor for the respondent - State.\nHeard on I.A. No.15174/2023, which is first application under Section 389(1) of Cr.P.C. moved on behalf of appellant No.1 - Child IN Conflict with law seeking suspension of sentence and grant of bail.\nAppellant stands convicted under Section 450 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 05 years RI with fine of Rs.500/-, under Section 328 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 05 years RI with fine of Rs.500/- and under Section 6 of POCSO Act read with Section 376(D) of IPC and sentenced to undergo 20 years' RI with fine of Rs.50,000/- with default stipulation vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 01.08.2023 passed by the Special Judge (POCSO Act), Bhind (Madhya Pradesh) in Special Case (ST No.) No.80/2021. As per prosecution story, while parents of the prosecutrix had gone away to attend a marriage, her brother and sister were sleeping on the terrace and she was sleeping in the courtyard on the ground floor, on 11.05.2019, at about 12 in the intervening night, accused - Jitendra, Rohit and present appellant (juvenile) entered the house from terrace area and caught hold the prosecutrix. She was dragged in a room, where she was forced to consume liquor, while present appellant-(juvenile) and another accused were standing outside the room. Main accused Jitendra committed rape on the prosecutrix. Accordingly, case has been registered. Upon filing of challan, the case was committed for trial to the Sessions Court. The Sessions Court upon critical evaluation of the evidence placed on record has convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred above. Learned counsel for the appellant at the first instance fairly submits that the appellant (juvenile) has already suffered the jail incarceration for almost three years. There is no allegation of either violating the personal liberty of the prosecutrix or committing rape. Instead, the sole allegation against him is that he entered the house and was standing outside the room, where she was sexually abused by the main accused Jitendra. As such the conviction of the appellant under Section 376(D) of IPC and 5(G) and 6 of POCSO is fully unwarranted and based on surmises and conjecture. The appellant even otherwise, has no criminal antecedents. It is further submitted that co-accused Rohit has already been granted bail by this Court and the case of the present appellant is akin to his case. Hence, prays for suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent-State opposes the application supporting the order impugned with the submission that the appellant and two accused persons had entered the house of the prosecutrix with common intention of commission of rape. The active participation is well specific from the story of the prosecution and the evidence placed on record during trial. Hence, no exception can be taken in the matter of suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Upon hearing counsel for the parties, though this Court refrains from commenting upon rival contentions touching merits of the matter but looking to nature of allegation and since the appellant is having no criminal record, the application deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, we allow the application and it is directed that the jail sentence of the appellant - (juvenile) shall remain suspended and he be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court subject to verification of factum regarding deposit of fine amount. Appellant is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court on 23.11.2023 and on other subsequent dates as may be fixed in this behalf with following further conditions:- (i) the concerned jail authorities are directed that before releasing the appellant, the medical examination of the appellant be conducted through the jail doctor and if it is prima facie found that she is having any symptoms of COVID-19, then the consequential follow up action or any further test required be undertaken immediately. If not, appellant shall be released on bail in terms of the conditions imposed in this order ; (ii) violation of conditions, State is free to apply for cancellation of bail. Accordingly, I.A. No.15174/2023 stands allowed and disposed of. Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of deciding the instant I.A. and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal.",
    "Question": "According to the passage, what alternatives does the juvenile appellant have regarding the conviction under the POCSO Act? Is there a possibility for the court to consider his overall lack of direct involvement in the sexual assault as a valid argument for a legal remedy?",
    "A": "The juvenile has no alternatives and must serve his conviction.",
    "B": "Yes, the court can appeal based on procedural errors only.",
    "C": "Yes, he can argue for bail and appeal against the conviction based on the lack of direct involvement.",
    "D": "No, the juvenile cannot approach the court regarding his conviction.",
    "Correct Answer": "Yes, he can argue for bail and appeal against the conviction based on the lack of direct involvement.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage provides that the appellant has already requested for bail by addressing his limited role in the incident. This possibility for the juvenile to appeal against the conviction using his lack of direct involvement suggests that viable legal remedies are available to him."

While doing this act, he had closed her mouth with his hand to ensure that the child did not make any noise. The appellant also threatened the child not to inform about this incident to anyone. After this incident, the child came back home and slept. She was woken up by her mother at 09.30 p.m. and the child was running a temperature. After a lot of persuasion, the victim child informed her mother about the incident. The mother of the victim child went and questioned the sister of the appellant viz., Manjula (A-2) about this incident and the said Manjula (A-2) is said to have abused the parents of the victim child in filthy language and threatened them.

Respondent(s) For Applicants(s) : Shri Akshay Sail, Advocate For Respondent/State : Ms.Pragya Shrivastava, Dy.GA (Hon'ble Shri Justice Arvind Kumar Verma) Order on Board 25/03/2025 As the above three M.Cr.Cs. are arising out of the same Crime Number, they are being disposed of by this common order. 2. The applicants have filed this bail application under Section 483 of the Bhartiya Nagrrik Suraksha Sanhita for grant of regular bail as they are in custody in connection with Crime No. 256/2024 registered at police station Mahasamund, District Mahasamund (CG) for the offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(n), 376(3), 506 Part-II/34 of IPC, Section 6 of the POCSO and Section 67 of the IT Act. 3. Prosecution case in brief is that report was lodged against the applicants on 19.05.2024 alleging that the applicants took the prosecutrix to the doctor on 17.05.2024 as she was complaining of stomach ache and on examination, she was found pregnant. Thereafter on 18.05.2024, she was admitted at Aditya Hospital, Mahasamund for treatment. It is the case of prosecution that the applicant in M.Cr.C. No. 1463/2025 were having love affair and on 21.01.2024 they developed physical relations and the co-accused persons helped the applicant in the said offence. Based on the said report two more Crime Nos. were registered against two different persons namely Rajendra Sahu and Tulsi Sahu (Cr. Nos. 257/2024 and 258/2024) respectively. On the basis of the said report, the police registered the offence against the accused persons and they were arrested. 4. Counsel for the applicants submits that the applicants have been falsely implicated in the case. He further contended that the FIR was lodged with a delay of about 5 months. It is contended that the incident took place on 19.01.2024 and 21.01.2024 whereas the FIR was lodged on 19.05.2024. It is contended that two more FIRs have been registered against two others of the same offence of sexual assault and therefore the testimony of the prosecutrix not credible and creates doubt as she has narrated different stories in her statements. It is submitted that the accused Rajendra Sahu in Crime No. 257/2024 has been granted bail by this Court in M.Cr.C. No. 6869/2024 vide order dated 08.01.2025, therefore the present applicants may also be granted similar benefit. 5. It is contended on behalf of the applicants namely, Ashik Nishad and Ganesh Nishad in M.Cr.C. Nos. 1464/2025 and 1467/2025 receptively that they have only assisted the applicant Guman Nishad in the commission of rape. Lastly, it is submitted that the charge sheet has been filed, they are in jail since 20.05.2024 and the trial is likely to take some time, they are ready and willing to comply with any of the conditions which may be imposed upon them and thus, it is submitted that the application be allowed and the applicants be released on bail. 6. Learned counsel for the respondent/State, on the other hand, has opposed the bail applications and submits that applicant Ashik Nishad in M.Cr.C. No1464/2025 had transmitted in the electronic form and made it viral. 7. Heard counsel for the parties and perused the record. 8. From perusal of the prosecution case, the accused Guman Nishad had developed physical relation with the victim, she became pregnant and thereafter when her parents came to know about the incident, the report was lodged. However, after the victim gave birth to a child and DNA test was done and as per the report, applicant was not the biological father of the child. 9. Here in the present case, though the applicant had denied to have made any physical relation with the prosecutrix but considering the fact that it was not the first occasion when the complaint was made by the prosecutrix for committing rape but in the same vein she made similar type of allegations against other persons also. Thus, taking into consideration the fact that they are in jail since 20.05.2024, charge sheet has been filed and that the final disposal of the trial is likely to take sufficiently long time, the present applications deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, their bail applications are allowed. 10. It is directed that in the event of applicants' executing a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 10,000/- each with one surety to the satisfaction of the concerned trial court, they shall be released on bail on the following conditions: I) they shall file an undertaking to the effect that he/she shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in the Court. IN case of default of this condition, it shall be open for the trial court to treat it as abuse of liberty of bail and pass orders in accordance with law. ii) they shall remain present before the trial court on each date fixed, either personally or through his/her counsel. In case of his absence without sufficient cause, the trial court may proceed against him/her under Section 269 of BNS, 2023. iii) In case, the applicants misuse the liberty of bail during trial and in order to secure his/her presence, proclamation under Section 84 of the BNSS, 2023 is issued and the applicants failed to appear before the court on the date fixed in such proclamation, then, the trial court shall initiate proceedings against him/her. In accordance with law under Section 209 of BNS, 2023. iv) The applicants shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on the dates fixed for (i) opening of the case (ii) framing of charge and (iii) recording of statement under Section 351 of BNSS, 2023.If in the opinion of the trial court absence of the applicants are deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him/her in accordance with law.

    "Passage": "Both these petitions encompass common question(s) of law, besides encompassing common prayer(s), therefore, they are amenable for being decided through a common verdict. For the sake of convenience, the facts are being extracted from CRM-M-5650-2022. The gravamen of the lis, as encapsulated in the instant petition, is centered upon the validity of the impugned orders dated 19.02.2021, which are enclosed with the instant petition respectively as Annexures P1 to P4, and whereby, the sanction for prosecution of the respondents No.5 to 8, in Case No. RC 08(S)/2017/SC-III/CBI/New Delhi dated 22.09.2017, as sought by the C.B.I. under Section 197 Cr.P.C., has been declined by the respondent No.1-State of Haryana. Succinctly stated, the present case derives its origin from the infamous incident of Ryan International School, Gurugram, wherein, a student of 2nd class [a seven year old boy] [hereinafter referred to as the 'minor deceased'] was found murdered in the school premises. Initially, the investigation was conducted by the Haryana Police and they arrested one Ashok Kumar [a Conductor employed in the School Bus at the relevant time] as the accused behind the murder. Since there was a lot of hue and cry and the matter was highlighted throughout media, and, even the father of the minor deceased approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court for transfer of investigation, therefore, the State of Haryana issued a gazette notification, thus transferring the investigation of this case to the C.B.I. The investigation of the C.B.I. culminated in a juvenile student of the same school, namely, Bholu [imaginary name given by the trial Court to conceal the identity of the juvenile student] [hereinafter referred to as the 'C.C.L.'] being the sole culprit behind murder of the minor deceased. Moreover, post conducting a through investigation, the C.B.I. also reached a conclusion that, in fact, Ashok Kumar was falsely framed in the murder and he is totally innocent. The further shocking revelations, as emerged from the investigation conducted by the C.B.I. are that, the Special Investigation Team [constituted by Commissioner of Police, Gurugram] not only created false documents, but, also pressurized the material witnesses to depose against Ashok Kumar. Consequently, a supplementary report was filed by the C.B.I., thereby requesting to accord sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C. for prosecution of some of the members of the Special Investigation Team [i.e. respondents No.5 to 8]. This request was declined by the respondent No.1 through rendering the impugned orders. Therefore, fetching grievance from the impugned orders, the C.B.I. has instituted the instant petition(s).",
    "Question": "Given the proceedings surrounding the Ryan International School case and the allegations made against officials of the Special Investigation Team, what could be the necessary legal actions the C.B.I. may pursue to ensure accountability for fabricated evidence and the false wrongful implication of a suspect?",
    "A": "The C.B.I. should coordinate with other law enforcement agencies to gather more evidence and compile a stronger case without initiating prosecution.",

    "C": "The C.B.I. must go public with the evidence and undermine the credibility of the investigators to force a reconsideration of the sanction.",
    "D": "The C.B.I. should ultimately drop all charges against the involved parties and settle the issue amongst themselves.",

    "Passage": "C K Muhammed Jaseer vs State Of Kerala on 22 September, 2020\n\nThis is an application for regular bail under Section 439 of Cr.P.C.\nThe applicant is the sole accused in Crime No.630/2020 of Mattannur Police Station for having allegedly committed the offences punishable under Sections 388 and 506(i) of the I.P.C. and under Section 4 read with Section 3(c) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). The applicant was arrested on 24.07.2020 and he seeks regular bail. The prosecution case, in brief, is that on 20.06.2020, the applicant had allegedly committed unnatural offence and penetrative sexual assault on the victim, who is a 13 year old boy. The victim's father had allegedly contacted the Childline Centre and subsequently the matter was informed to the Police, in consequence of which the crime was registered. It is alleged that the incident took place in a toilet inside the compound of a hotel at a place called '19th Mile'. The applicant states that he is innocent, he has no other criminal antecedents and he is only 20 year old and that the entire allegations are false. It is stated that a similar incident had allegedly taken place on 19.06.2020 concerning the very same victim and he was allegedly sexually assaulted by a person named Siraj and in consequence of which Crime No.623/2020 as lodged against the said Siraj on 26.06.2020 in Mattannur Police Station. Even then, crime against the applicant was not registered and ultimately it was registered only on 02.07.2020. The delay, according to the applicant is very crucial. It is stated that the applicant is the leader of a youth organization and because of the action taken against him for registering the crime against Siraj, the applicant has been deliberately implicated in this crime also. He was arrested on 24.07.2020 and has been in custody for about 58 days, and therefore, seeks regular bail. Heard the learned Counsel for the applicant and the learned Public Prosecutor. The learned Public Prosecutor has vehemently opposed application for bail stating that the applicant has committed a heinous crime attracting the offence under the I.P.C. and also for offences under Section 4(1) of the POCSO Act. It is stated that the incident which took place on 19.06.2020 involving the accused-Siraj and the present incident which took place on 20.06.2020, were in two different places. But in both these cases, the victim was sexually abused. In connection with Crime No.623/2020 registered against Siraj, the statement of the victim was recorded by the Magistrate on 27.06.2020 and in that statement the victim revealed the involvement of Siraj in committing the offence on 19.06.2020 and also revealed the involvement of the applicant herein in another similar offence, which occurred on the successive date. The investigating officer got a copy of the statement under Section 164, Cr.P.C. from the Magistrate's Court on 02.07.2020 and immediately this crime was registered. Hence it is submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor that the delay is not very crucial. It is also submitted by the learned Counsel appearing for the applicant that Siraj, the accused in Crime No.623/2020 of Mattannur Police Station, had approached this Court for anticipatory bail and the same was rejected by this Court. But the accused in that crime has not been apprehended. It is submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor that in case the applicant is released on bail, there is every possibility that the victim and his family members may be threatened. There is also an offence under Section 506(i) of the I.P.C. registered against the applicant and it is because the applicant had put the victim to fear of death and also causing hurt to his family members and that the victim had not come forward with a complaint against the applicant. Under the circumstances, it is submitted that the release of the applicant at this stage would be detrimental to the investigation and also to the victim and his entire family. Moreover, it is submitted that investigation is complete and final report has already been filed. The applicant's contention that he has no criminal antecedents may not make a weigh in his favour, particularly for the reason that the applicant had intimidated the victim from disclosing the alleged occurrence. The incident did not take place in the very same place and the attempt made by the applicant to suggest that the actual incident of sexually abusing the victim had taken place on 19.06.2020 and that the assailant was Siraj and with other political motives, the applicant has been falsely implicated as an accused. This submission cannot be accepted for the reason that in the confession statement allegedly given by the victim on 27.06.2020 before the Magistrate he has clearly revealed the involvement of the applicant in this crime. The fact is that both the crimes took place on consecutive days. The fact that the applicant had intimidated the victim and that subsequently the relatives of the applicant had also intimidated the family members of the victim also would go a long way in refusing bail to the applicant. In the result, I find that the applicant, who is accused of committing a very heinous crime against a child, is not entitled to any leniency, and therefore, the application is dismissed. The learned designated Court is directed to expedite the trial and in case there is any delay in concluding the trial because of the pandemic situation, the applicant is given the liberty to approach the jurisdictional court again for bail afresh.",
    "Question": "In light of the provisions outlined in the POCSO Act applicable to this case, what implications does the court's judgment hold for the victim's rights and the obligations of authorities in handling such serious allegations of sexual offenses against minors?",
    "A": "The authorities must prioritize the rights and safety of the accused over the victim, allowing for leniency in serious allegations.",
    "B": "The judgment implies that the authorities are mandated to expedite the trial process, as demonstrated by the court's instruction to do so, thus prioritizing the victim's rights and safety.",
    "C": "The implication is that law enforcement can dismiss similar future cases without investigation, arguing that delays are justifiable.",
    "D": "The judgment demonstrates that only police actions are necessary to determine the truth of the allegations without further court involvement.",
    "Correct Answer": "The judgment implies that the authorities are mandated to expedite the trial process, as demonstrated by the court's instruction to do so, thus prioritizing the victim's rights and safety.",
    "Reasoning": "The court acknowledges the necessity to protect child victims and ensure that these cases are handled with the urgency they deserve, reflecting the legal and moral obligations to address such crimes seriously and efficiently."

Applicant(s) versus 1 - State Of Chhattisgarh Through The P.S. - Mahasamund, District - Mahasamund (Chhattisgarh). ... Respondent(s) For Applicants(s) : Shri Akshay Sail, Advocate For Respondent/State : Ms.Pragya Shrivastava, Dy.GA (Hon'ble Shri Justice Arvind Kumar Verma) Order on Board 25/03/2025 As the above three M.Cr.Cs. are arising out of the same Crime Number, they are being disposed of by this common order. The applicants have filed this bail application under Section 483 of the Bhartiya Nagrrik Suraksha Sanhita for grant of regular bail as they are in custody in connection with Crime No. 256/2024 registered at police station Mahasamund, District Mahasamund (CG) for the offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(n), 376(3), 506 Part-II/34 of IPC, Section 6 of the POCSO and Section 67 of the IT Act. Prosecution case in brief is that report was lodged against the applicants on 19.05.2024 alleging that the applicants took the prosecutrix to the doctor on 17.05.2024 as she was complaining of stomach ache and on examination, she was found pregnant. Thereafter on 18.05.2024, she was admitted at Aditya Hospital, Mahasamund for treatment. It is the case of prosecution that the applicant in M.Cr.C. No. 1463/2025 were having love affair and on 21.01.2024 they developed physical relations and the co-accused persons helped the applicant in the said offence. Based on the said report two more Crime Nos. were registered against two different persons namely Rajendra Sahu and Tulsi Sahu (Cr. Nos. 257/2024 and 258/2024) respectively. On the basis of the said report, the police registered the offence against the accused persons and they were arrested. Counsel for the applicants submits that the applicants have been falsely implicated in the case. He further contended that the FIR was lodged with a delay of about 5 months. It is contended that the incident took place on 19.01.2024 and 21.01.2024 whereas the FIR was lodged on 19.05.2024. It is contended that two more FIRs have been registered against two others of the same offence of sexual assault and therefore the testimony of the prosecutrix not credible and creates doubt as she has narrated different stories in her statements. It is submitted that the accused Rajendra Sahu in Crime No. 257/2024 has been granted bail by this Court in M.Cr.C. No. 6869/2024 vide order dated 08.01.2025, therefore the present applicants may also be granted similar benefit. It is contended on behalf of the applicants namely, Ashik Nishad and Ganesh Nishad in M.Cr.C. Nos. 1464/2025 and 1467/2025 receptively that they have only assisted the applicant Guman Nishad in the commission of rape. Lastly, it is submitted that the charge sheet has been filed, they are in jail since 20.05.2024 and the trial is likely to take some time, they are ready and willing to comply with any of the conditions which may be imposed upon them and thus, it is submitted that the application be allowed and the applicants be released on bail. Learned counsel for the respondent/State, on the other hand, has opposed the bail applications and submits that applicant Ashik Nishad in M.Cr.C. No1464/2025 had transmitted in the electronic form and made it viral. Heard counsel for the parties and perused the record. From perusal of the prosecution case, the accused Guman Nishad had developed physical relation with the victim, she became pregnant and thereafter when her parents came to know about the incident, the report was lodged. However, after the victim gave birth to a child and DNA test was done and as per the report, applicant was not the biological father of the child. Here in the present case, though the applicant had denied to have made any physical relation with the prosecutrix but considering the fact that it was not the first occasion when the complaint was made by the prosecutrix against the applicant for committing rape but in the same vein she made similar type of allegations against other persons also. Thus, taking into consideration the fact that they are in jail since 20.05.2024, charge sheet has been filed and that the final disposal of the trial is likely to take sufficiently long time, the present applications deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, their bail applications are allowed. It is directed that in the event of applicants' executing a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 10,000/- each with one surety to the satisfaction of the concerned trial court, they shall be released on bail on the following conditions: I) they shall file an undertaking to the effect that he/she shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in the Court. IN case of default of this condition, it shall be open for the trial court to treat it as abuse of liberty of bail and pass orders in accordance with law. ii) they shall remain present before the trial court on each date fixed, either personally or through his/her counsel. In case of his absence without sufficient cause, the trial court may proceed against him/her under Section 269 of BNS, 2023. iii) In case, the applicants misuse the liberty of bail during trial and in order to secure his/her presence, proclamation under Section 84 of the BNSS, 2023 is issued and the applicants failed to appear before the court on the date fixed in such proclamation, then, the trial court shall initiate proceedings against him/her. in accordance with law under Section 209 of BNS, 2023. iv) The applicants shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on the dates fixed for (I) opening of the case (ii) framing of charge and (iii) recording of statement under Section 351 of BNSS, 2023.If in the opinion of the trial court absence of the applicants are deliberate or without sufficient cause,t hen it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him/her in accordance with law.",

The gist of the prosecution case is that the mother of the victim girl aged 11 years has been working as an employee of the bakery run by the petitioner accused and that at times, the mother used to go out for collection purposes to take care some of her other business activities, at which time, she used to leave her child in the bakery and that the petitioner has sexually abused the minor victim girl on those occasions, by kissing and embracing her, etc. and that the petitioner had attempted to bite her lips, and that the child had beaten him and had told the incident to the mother, etc. 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the abovesaid allegations have been falsely foisted against the petitioner and that the mother of the victim girl had left the employment of the petitioner's bakery and had joined the employment of one Vamban, who is running a medical shop. That the petitioner had earlier advanced certain monies to Vamban and the cheque issued by him in favour of the petitioner to discharge such liabilities was bounced, upon which the petitioner had sent Anx.1 demand notice dated 22.9.2018 demanding return of the said money covered by the dishonoured cheque, to which the said Vamban had given Anx. II reply dated 8.10.208 threatening the petitioner that it is known that the petitioner had sexually abused the mother of the victim girl as well as the victim girl and that those aspects would be brought to light, etc. 4. It is pointed out that after issuance of Anx. II reply dated 8.10.2018, the mother of the child had given complaint to the Police on 26.10.2018, which has led to the institution of the instant crime, and that the impugned criminal proceedings are tainted by malicious and ulterior considerations and has been foisted only at the instance of the person, who has issued Anx.II notice in order to wreck vengeance on the petitioner. 5. Per contra, the learned Prosecutor would submit that the allegations raised against the petitioner are serious and that the truth or otherwise of the petitioner's allegations cannot be assessed at this point of time and on this basis, the learned Prosecutor opposes the grant of anticipatory bail. 6. After having heard both sides and taking into account the abovesaid facts of the case and other attendant circumstances dealt with herein above, this Court is of the considered view that the custodial interrogation may not be really warranted. However, it is necessary that the investigation process is duly completed with due co-operation of the petitioner. Accordingly, it is ordered that: The petitioner will surrender before the investigating officer for interrogation process two weeks from the date notified for receiving certified copy of this order and after the interrogation process is over, the investigating officer shall produce the petitioner before the jurisdictional Magistrate court concerned, who is dealing with the abovesaid crime and the petitioner may then submit application for grant of bail, advance copy of which shall be given to the learned Prosecutor and thereupon, the learned Magistrate will consider the said application for bail on the same day and will pass orders thereon after affording reasonable opportunity of being heard to the petitioner's counsel and the learned Prosecutor, on the same day. It is made clear that in case the petitioner does not surrender before the investigating officer concerned as directed herein above, then the direction issued herein above will stand automatically vacated. With these observations and directions, the above Bail Application stands finally disposed of. Sd/- sdk+ ALEXANDER THOMAS, JUDGE",

    "Passage": "Kerala High Court Liju vs State Of Kerala on 3 April, 2019 Bail Appl..No. 124 of 2019 CRIME NO. 1641/2018 OF Enathu Police Station , Pathanamthitta PETITIONER/S: LIJU, AGED 21 YEARS S/O RAJU, THENGAMOM MURI, THENGAMAM, ADOOR, PATHANAMTHITTA-691523. BY ADV. SRI.K.SHAJ RESPONDENT/S: 1 STATE OF KERALA, REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM-682031. 2 SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE, ENATHU POLICE STATION, PATHANAMTHITTA DISTRICT, KERALA-691523. OTHER PRESENT: SRI.C.N.PRABHAKARAN-SENIOR PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 03.04.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bail Appl..No. 124 of 2019 ORDER Apprehending his arrest, petitioner seeks anticipatory bail under Sec.438 of Cr.P.C. He is alleged to have committed offences punishable under Sec.354 of IPC, Sec.8 of the PoCSO Act and Sec.75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act ( JJ Act for short). The police of Enathu police station in Pathanamthitta district has registered a case as crime no.1641/2018 against the petitioner. Prosecution case goes as follows: It all happened at around 1 p.m on 21.12.2018. The victim girl aged 16 years was returning from her school along with her friends. When they reached Karimpara junction, the petitioner who came on a scooter abused the girl. He caught her hand. When she objected, he slapped on her face twice. Heard Sri.K.Shaj, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri.C.N.Prabhakaran, the learned senior public prosecutor. It seems that Sec.75 of the JJ Act is out of question. Sec.75 provides punishment for cruelty to child. In order to attract Sec.75, the offender must be a person who is in actual charge of or control over the victim child. The prosecution has no such case. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that catching the hand or slapping on the face do not attract the penal provisions in Sec.354 of IPC. It is also alleged that Sec.8 of the PoCSO Act is not attracted inasmuch as the acts alleged against the petitioner do not fall within the ambit of the definition of sexual assault contained in Sec.7 of the PoCSO Act. It is also the submission of the learned counsel that there is no allegation against the petitioner that he touched any parts of the body of the girl specifically referred to in Sec.7. It is also his submission that catching the hand and slapping on the face cannot be termed as an act with sexual intent. It is too premature to have a positive or negative finding on the arguments of the learned counsel. But his arguments cannot be totally ignored or brushed aside. I do not consider the present case to be one where custodial interrogation of the petitioner is an absolute must for an effective investigation of the case. Considering all these matters, I am inclined to grant him bail. The application is allowed. If arrested in connection with crime no.1641/2018 of Enathu police station, the petitioner shall be released on bail, after interrogation, on his executing a bond for Rs 75,000/- (seventy five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the investigating officer. The petitioner shall co-operate with the investigation. He shall make himself available for interrogation if so required by the investigating officer. He shall report to the investigating officer between 10 am and 11 am on every Saturday for a period of three months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. The petitioner shall not intimidate or try to influence witnesses. He shall not destroy or tamper with evidence. The court having jurisdiction is hereby empowered to cancel the bail in accordance with law if any of the conditions mentioned above is violated. If the petitioner surrenders before the court concerned, this order will cease to have effect and the said court will pass appropriate orders as if this order has not been passed.

The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No.388 of 2018 of the Kilikolloor Police Station, registered under B' 354A of the IPC, B' 9(n) r/w. B' 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, and also under B'75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2015. 3. The de facto complainant is the mother of the survivor child, who is aged about 14 years and studying in the IX Standard. She alleged that her daughter was found missing on 11.6.2018 from school. A crime was registered under Section 57 of the Kerala Police Act, 2011. The minor child was traced out later. She disclosed that she was in love with a boy and she had eloped with him. She also disclosed that she has had an active sexual relationship with the said boy, who is aged 19 years. In the said statement, she also disclosed that the applicant herein, who is her step-father, has touched her breasts with sexual intent on more than one occasion. On these allegations, two Crimes were registered. Crime No.387 of 2018 was registered against her 19 year old lover under B'B' 366 and 376(2)(n) of the IPC and under B' 5(1) r/w. B' 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012. Immediately thereafter, the instant crime was registered against the applicant for sexually harassing the child. 4. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that he has been implicated as his step-daughter felt that he was responsible for the arrest and detention of her lover. As the child was quite young, the applicant herein along with his wife had strongly opposed the relationship that she had with the accused in Crime No.387 of 2018. It is contended that after the death of the father of the minor child about three years back, the applicant has married her mother and he has been caring and protecting the family. Finally, it is submitted that the applicant has been in custody from 12.6.2018 and prays that orders for his release be issued. 5. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who has opposed the prayer. It is submitted that the medical examination report of the child shows that she has been subjected to penetrative sexual assault by the 1st accused. It is further submitted that the child has unequivocally stated that the applicant herein had abused her on more than one occasions. 6. I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone through the case diary. It appears that the applicant herein has been residing with the family after marrying the mother for the past more than two years. Allegations have been levelled against him only after registration of the crime against the lover of the child. The contention of the learned counsel that he has been implicated for his exuberance in prosecuting the lover of the survivor cannot be ruled out at this stage. Furthermore, serious allegations are levelled against the 1 st accused. The investigation appears to have progressed much and in the facts and circumstances further detention in custody of the applicant may not serve any purpose. By imposing appropriate conditions, for safeguarding the interest of the prosecution as well as the protection of the minor child, the applicant can now be released. 7. In the result, this application will stand allowed. The applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond for Rs.1,00,000/-(Rupees one lakh only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court having jurisdiction. The above order shall be subject to the following conditions: 1). The applicant shall appear before the Investigating Officer on all Saturdays between 10 a.m. and 1.00 p.m., for 3 months or till final report is filed, whichever is earlier. 2). He shall not enter the limits of Kilikkolloor Police Station for a period of six months except for complying with the conditions of this order. If for any extraordinary reason the applicant requires to enter the limits, previous permission has to be obtained from the jurisdictional Court. 3). He shall not intimidate or attempt to influence the witnesses; nor shall he tamper with the evidence. He shall not contact the victim or her family members. 4). He shall not commit any offence while he is on bail. 5). He shall not leave India without the permission of the Court and if having passport, shall deposit the same before the Trial Court within a week; If release of the passport is required at a later period, he shall be at liberty to move appropriate application before the Court having jurisdiction. In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the jurisdictional Court shall be empowered to consider the application for cancellation, if any, and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law.

Shah- Advocate for the appellant. Dr. Anjali Gyanani - Public Prosecutor for respondent/State. Heard on I.A. No.7003 of 2023, which is first application under Section 389(1) Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of appellant-Akhtar Khan seeking suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Appellant-Akhtar Khan stood convicted under Section 4(2) of POCSO Act and sentenced to undergo 20 years' R.I. with a fine of Rs.2,000/- and under Section 9 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and sentenced to undergo 2 years' R.I with a fine of Rs.1,000/- with default stipulations vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 15/12/2022 passed by Special Judge (POCSO Act), Shivpuri (M.P.) in Special Case No.124/2019. Present appellant so far has undergone incarceration of about 17 months in toto, as transpired during the course of hearing. Co-accused/Appellant No.1 in Criminal Appeal No.838 of 2023-Shakil Khan is the biological father of the prosecutrix as after the demise of his first wife and mother of the prosecutrix, he married to co-accused Shehnaz Bano. As per prosecution story, the prosecutrix claiming herself to be 14 years of age, on 20/09/2019, lodged an FIR to the effect that for the last 4-5 years since the time her mother expired, she was ill-treated by her step-mother Shehnaz Bano off and on. She, therefore, had left the house and started living with her grand-parents. Thereafter, on 1/1/2019, while she was staying with her maternal uncle's house, step-mother Shehnaz came there and against her wishes brought her back. Thereafter, she started searching for the match though she was not major. She manipulated her marriage (Nikah) with accused/appellant Akhtar and Farukh Khan had reduced in writing the process of Nikah. After so-called solemnization of marriage (Nikah), she was subjected to forcible sexual abuse against her wishes by Akhtar from 24/08/2019 to 28/08/2019. Thereafter, accused/appellant Akhtar called her grand-parents to the Kota Court and whereafter, signing of certain documents, she was given in custody of her grand-parents. Thereafter, she came back to her grand-parents' house from Kota. It is alleged that appellant Akhtar had also threatened the prosecutrix with dire consequences, if she divulged the factum of marriage and that of sexual abuse. In the aforesaid backdrop, the prosecutrix filed the complaint and the same was registered at Crime No.213/19. Based thereupon, investigation was set in motion. The Investigating Officer, upon collection of incriminating evidence, filed challan. The Special Court upon critical evaluation of the evidence placed on record convicted and sentenced the present appellant as aforesaid. Learned counsel for the appellant while taking exception to the impugned judgement submits that the prosecutrix in her statement before the Court has clearly stated that her date of birth is 11/10/2000 as recorded in Aadhar Card and therefore, she was major as on the date of incident. However, the trial Court in Para-20 of the judgement, ignored the same and relied upon her date of birth as per the certificate of the Municipal Corporation, Kota (Ex.P/10) as 11/10/2005. That apart, she has turned hostile and belied the story of prosecution. Shakil Khan, co-convict/appellant No.1 in Criminal Appeal No.838 of 2023, has already been admitted to suspension of sentence and grant of bail vide order dated 27.04.2023. On such grounds, learned counsel prays for suspension of sentence and grant of bail to the present appellant. Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor for respondent/State, while opposing the application supporting the judgment impugned submits that looking to the gravity of offence, no exception can be taken in the matter of suspension of sentence and grant of bail to the present appellant. Upon hearing learned counsel for the parties, though this Court refrains from commenting upon rival contentions touching merits of the case but regard being had to the fact that co-convict/appellant No.1 -Shakil Khan in Criminal Appeal No.838 of 2023 has already been admitted to suspension of sentence and grant of bail vide order dated 27.04.2023, the present appellant has so far undergone incarceration of 17 months in toto coupled with the fact that appeal is of the year 2023 and there is no likelihood of its early hearing in near future and therefore, in the obtaining facts and circumstances, we hereby extend the benefit of suspension of sentence and grant of bail to present appellant-Akhtar Khan. Accordingly, I.A.7003 of 2023 stands allowed and it is directed that the jail sentence of appellant-Akhtar Khan shall remain suspended during pendency of present appeal and he shall be released on bail, subject to verification of amount of fine being deposited and on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lacs only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. Appellant-Akhtar Khan is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court first on 13.09.2023 and on other subsequent dates as may be fixed by Office in this behalf. Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of disposal of the application for suspension of sentence and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal. Certified copy as per rules.

    "Passage": "State vs. Ajit, on 29 July, 2017 IN THE COURT OF SH. SANJAY GARG, ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE­01, DWARKA COURTS, NEW DELHI. Sessions Case No. 440819/2016 State Vs. Ajit, S/o Sh. Uppender Kumar, R/o A­207, J.J. Colony, Manglapuri, Phase­II, Palam, New Delhi. FIR No.: 706/2015 Police Station: Palam Village Under Section: 354A/354D/324 IPC & 12 POCSO Act Date of presentation of charge sheet: 25.04.2016 Date on which judgment was reserved: 29.07.2017 Date on which judgment was pronounced: 29.07.2017 JUDGMENT: 1. The FIR was registered on the complaint lodged by the child victim. At that time, she was about 15 years old. In the complaint, the child victim alleged that the accused used to follow her, hurl vulgar abuses and make indecent gestures to her. She further alleged that on 08.12.2015 at about 8 a.m., when she alongwith her friend was going to school, the accused caught hold of her hand and proposed her for marriage and upon her refusal, he caused injury on her left hand with a blade and thereafter, pushed her due to which, she fell down and sustained injuries on her head. Consequent upon the registration of FIR, the accused was arrested. The statements of the witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C. were recorded. The statement of the child victim was also got recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. After completion of investigation, the charge sheet was filed. 2. On 08.07.2016, the charge for the offences punishable under Sections 8/12 POCSO Act and Section 324 IPC was framed against the accused Ajit. He pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 3. The prosecution examined the child victim, her friend, father and mother as PW1 to PW4 respectively. 4. Vide order of even date, the remaining prosecution evidence was closed and the statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was dispensed with. 5. I have heard the Addl. PP for the State and the counsel for the accused. The material on record has also been perused. 6. The child victim and her friend were the star witnesses of the case of the prosecution. The child victim appeared in the witness box as PW1. In her deposition, though she corroborated the incident to the extent that a boy had proposed her for marriage near her school and upon her refusal, he had pushed her resulting in head injury to her but she turned hostile on the aspect of identity of the accused. She was cross-examined by the Addl. PP. In her cross-examination, she denied the suggestion of the Addl. PP that the accused used to follow her and reiterated that he had not met her on the date of the incident. As per the case of the prosecution, the child victim was accompanied with her friend on the date of incident. The friend of the child victim was examined by the prosecution as PW2. In her testimony, she also failed to support the case of the prosecution and did not utter anything incriminating against the accused. Besides the child victim and her friend, the prosecution examined the father and mother of the child victim as PW3 and PW4 respectively. However even they did not support the case of the prosecution and denied the suggestion of the Addl. PP that the child victim had told them that the accused used to follow her and had sexually assaulted her and caused injuries to her on the date of incident. Since the material witnesses had not supported the case of the prosecution, it would have been a futile exercise to examine the remaining prosecution witnesses, who were formal in nature. The prosecution evidence was therefore closed. As no incriminating evidence came on record against the accused, his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was dispensed with. 7. In the light of the above discussion, it is evident that the prosecution has miserably failed to bring home the guilt of the accused.

She has expressed her willingness to go alongwith mother and she is not at all willing to go alongwith her father. In the order dated 08.10.2021 we have thoroughly discussed as to how the petitioner-natural mother of minor daughter Juhi @ Tanishka had to run from pillar to post for getting interim custody of her minor daughter Juhi @ Tanishka in the backdrop of registration of crime against father of Juhi @ Tanishka. So far as the health issue of minor girl Juhi @ Tanishka is concerned, in terms of order dated 08.10.2021, she was referred to the hospital name and style as Varad Medical Foundation Institute of Child Health, Aurangabad.

In the circumstances, it would be just and appropriate if the interim custody of minor child Juhi @ Tanishka Rahul Wadhave is given to the petitioner forthwith.

Succinctly stated, the present case derives its origin from the infamous incident of Ryan International School, Gurugram, wherein, a student of 2nd class [a seven year old boy] [hereinafter referred to as the 'minor deceased'] was found murdered in the school premises. Initially, the investigation was conducted by the Haryana Police and they arrested one Ashok Kumar [a Conductor employed in the School Bus at the relevant time] as the accused behind the murder. Since there was a lot of hue and cry and the matter was highlighted throughout media, and, even the father of the minor deceased approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court for transfer of investigation, therefore, the State of Haryana issued a gazette notification, thus transferring the investigation of this case to the C.B.I. The investigation of the C.B.I. culminated in a juvenile student of the same school, namely, Bholu [imaginary name given by the trial Court to conceal the identity of the juvenile student] [hereinafter referred to as the 'C.C.L.'] being the sole culprit behind murder of the minor deceased. Moreover, post conducting a through investigation, the C.B.I. also reached a conclusion that, in fact, Ashok Kumar was falsely framed in the murder and he is totally innocent. The further shocking revelations, as emerged from the investigation conducted by the C.B.I. are that, the Special Investigation Team [constituted by Commissioner of Police, Gurugram] not only created false documents, but, also pressurized the material witnesses to depose against Ashok Kumar. Consequently, a supplementary report was filed by the C.B.I., thereby requesting to accord sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C. for prosecution of some of the members of the Special Investigation Team [i.e. respondents No.5 to 8]. This request was declined by the respondent No.1 through rendering the impugned orders. Therefore, fetching grievance from the impugned orders, the C.B.I. has instituted the instant petition(s).",

    "Passage": "CRR No.2085 of 2016 (O&M) Date of Decision: July 17, 2018 Dharambir ...Petitioner Versus State of Haryana and another ...Respondents CORAM:- HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE JAISHREE THAKUR Present:- Mr. S.S. Momi, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. P.P. Chahar, DAG Haryana. Mr. J.S. Mehndiratta, Advocate for respondents No.2 and 3. This is a criminal revision filed against the order dated 13.05.2016 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Sonepat, where the application filed by the petitioner-complainant under Section 216 of Code of Criminal Procedure for amendment in the charges, by way of framing the charge under Section 305 of Indian Penal Code instead of 306 of IPC and for further framing the charge under Section 376 of IPC and Sections 6, 8, 12 of the POCSO Act read with Section 120-B of IPC against the accused persons, has been dismissed. In short, the facts of the case are that FIR No.452 dated 05.09.2015 came to be registered under Section 306 read with Section 34 of IPC at Police Station Sadar, Sonipat against respondents No.2 and 3 herein on the complaint of petitioner-complainant that on 05.09.2015 at around 05.00 his daughter Deepika committed suicide due to threatening given by Hanni and his mother Suman (respondents No.2 and 3 herein). It was also alleged that when his daughter went to South Point School tour to Delhi, accused Hanni also reached there and did obscene act with his daughter. When his daughter Deepika returned back, she disclosed this incident to her mother, on which they narrated this matter to Hanni's family, but instead of rebuking her son, Hanni's mother insulted Deepika. Hanni's mother also went to South Point School and insulted his daughter Deepika. Deepika was very upset with the behaviour of Hanni and his mother Suman, compelling her to the extreme step of committing suicide. During the course of investigation, a suicide note was recovered from the lower/trouser worn by the deceased at the time of her death, which was sent to FSL for verification of handwriting of the deceased and as per the report of Forensic Science Laboratory, the handwriting on the suicide note is of the deceased. After completing the investigation, final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was filed in the court against respondents No.2 and 3 under Sections 306/34 of IPC and thereafter, the trial court framed the charges under Sections 306/34 of IPC by an order dated 11.12.2015. Thereafter, the petitioner-complainant moved an application under Section 216 Cr.P.C. for amendment of charge on the ground that since the deceased in the instant case was less than 18 years of age, she was a child, and therefore, charge under Section 305 of IPC is required to be framed instead of Section 306 of IPC, but the said application came to be dismissed on 27.01.2016. Thereafter, a supplementary challan was filed by the police under Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C containing documents, birth certificate of Deepika (deceased) and statement of her mother Ishwanti. After that, the petitioner-complainant filed another application under Section 216 of Cr.P.C. for amendment in the charges, by way of framing the charge under Section 305 of IPC instead of 306 of IPC and for further framing the charge under Section 376 of IPC and Sections 6, 8, 12 of the POCSO Act read with Section 120-B of IPC against the accused persons, which application came to be dismissed by the impugned order dated 13.05.2016. Mr. S.S. Momi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner argues that it is an admitted fact on the case file the date of birth of deceased Deepika was 09.11.2000 and on the date of the occurrence, the deceased was minor, aged about 14 years, at the time when she committed suicide. The age of the deceased is mentioned as 14 years on the postmortem report. It is contended that as per the suicide note, the accused committed 'jabardasti' with the deceased. Meaning thereby, the deceased was molested and sexually abused and as such, charges under Sections 305, 376 of IPC and Sections 6, 8, 12 of POCSO Act read with Section 120-B of IPC are made out against the accused. Mr. J.S. Mehndiratta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents No.2 and 3 argues that there is nothing on record to amend the charges already framed. It is submitted that the earlier application filed by the learned Public Prosecutor under Section 216 of Cr.P.C. for amendment of charge has already been dismissed by the trial court and the suicide note was already on the file at the time of framing of charges in the present case. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, apart from perusing the record. On the basis of the complaint filed by the petitioner-complainant and the investigation done by the police, final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was filed under Section 306 read with Section 34 of IPC. The earlier application moved under Section 216 Cr.P.C. came to be dismissed on 27.01.2016 by the trial court, while observing that there is no material pertaining to date of birth of the deceased in the form of birth certificate or in the statement of her father has been found. Thereafter, a supplementary challan came to be filed under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. containing the date of birth certificate of the deceased. However, the trial court has not said anything about the date of birth certificate of the deceased. The trial court further observed the suicide note prima facie makes out an offence under Section 306 of IPC, although the trial court did not consider the date of birth certificate of the deceased, submitted in the form of supplementary statement. Under these peculiar facts and circumstances, prima facie, at this stage, a case under Section 305 read with Section 34 of IPC is made out against the accused persons and the charge is required to be altered accordingly. In view of the above, the criminal revision in hand is partly allowed and the impugned order passed by the trial court is set aside to the above extent only.",

Respondent Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking to transfer the investigation to CBCID, Kancheepuram.

On a complaint lodged by the petitioner, the respondent Police registered a case in Cr.No.290 of 2015 for the offence under Section 4 of POCSO Act and Sections 294 (b) and 506(i) IPC against Srinivasan, who was arrested by Police and has now been released on bail. It is the grievance of the petitioner that the investigation is not going on a right line and therefore, he sought for transfer of the same to any Specialized Agency. This Court perused the case diary. Statement of the victim girl has been recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. and she has also been subjected to medical examination. It is the further grievance of the petitioner that the Police have not taken any steps to have the DNA Profiling done between the accused and child. A copy of the statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. is not available in the case diary. In a case of this nature, it would be sufficient, if the victim girl gives evidence with general corroboration from other sources. Under such circumstances, this Court is of the view, it is not a fit case to transfer the investigation to any other agency. Under such circumstances, this Court, in the interest of justice, directs the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Madhuranthagam, to supervise the investigation in Cr.No.290 of 2015.

The marriage of prosecutrix with the original accused no. 7 and the applicant no. 1 herein was performed as per the Muslim Personal law and with the consent of the parties the Nikah had been performed. Under section 11 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 ['POCSO' for short] so also under section 3 & 16 of the said Act and also under Section 376 read with 114 IPC, after the investigation, the chargesheet had been laid. It is the case of the applicants that Islam permits marriage at the age of 15 years, therefore, the limitation prescribed under the law for marriage of 18 years for the girl would not come in the way of the applicants. Moreover, the Court added Sections 4 & 17 of the POCSO which are the provisions prescribed for punishment under Section 3 and 16 respectively, that also has aggrieved the applicants. Learned advocate Mr. Malik appearing for all the applicants has urged that it is an internal dispute of the family which has brought to the fore the factum of child marriage. He has urged that the girl's statement also reveals that the paternal uncle of the girl since did not enjoy good relationship with the family, has complained against such marriage. He urged that the applicants are not only aggrieved by imposition of Section 4 & 17 of the POSCO but also for non grant of their application where they made a request for discharge from all the offences. He has fervently urged that the radiological report is clearly indicative of the fact that the prosecutrix is between 16 -18 years and therefore also, this Court requires to interfere with the order of discharge passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Dhrangadhra. Learned APP Ms. Punani has urged that the very object of the Act of 2012 is to protect the children who are not adequately protected, as they require security at the tender age. She urged that the age of prosecutrix was 13 years at the time of her so-called marriage, and therefore, the trial Court was right in not discharging the applicants-accused of the charges levelled against them. She further urged that Section 3 of the POSCO Act, 2012 speaks of penetrative sexual assault; Section 4 prescribes punishment for penetrative sexual assault and Section 16 likewise is with respect to abetment of an offence and section 17 prescribes punishment for abetment. Such additions, therefore, would not warrant any interference. Having thus heard both the sides, for the reasons to follow hereinafter, this application deserves dismissal. When there is sufficient ground existing for the Court to frame the charges on the basis of evidence that may be adduced by the prosecution by way of paper of chargesheet, the Court can frame the charges. Once the case is presented to the Court, it is required of the Court to sift through the material and it becomes its bounden duty to ensure that the reasonable ground is made out from such material for the Court to frame the charges. The law on the subject is well-settled. It is also reiterated recently, referring to all earlier laws by the Apex Court in case of L Krishna Reddy v. State by Station House Officer & Ors., reported in (2014) 14 SCC 401. As could be noticed from the material on record, the birth date of the prosecutrix is 10th September 1999. The marriage according to the prosecution took place with the applicant no.1 herein on 23rd August 2013 when the prosecutrix was only 13 years old. The trial Court has rightly observed that the victim being less than 15 years of age, the provisions of POSCO Act 2012 which are otherwise meant for protecting the abuse of the children have been rightly invoked, even if the parents were agreeable to such marriage, the law will take its own course. Moreover, addition of Sections 4 & 17 is merely incidental as substantive provisions of Sections 3 & 16 were already forming part of the chargesheet. On neither count, this application warrants interference at the hands of this Court. Moreover, there is no grave miscarriage of justice nor there is any manifest illegality which deserves indulgence. Resultantly, Criminal Misc. Application fails and the same is rejected.",
    "Question": "In the given scenario, where a 13-year-old girl was married under Muslim Personal Law, what legal provisions are invoked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, and what implications does this have for the accused in terms of their legal accountability and potential charges they may face?",
    "A": "The accused will be free from any legal accountability since the marriage was consensual.",
    "B": "The accused may face charges under the POSCO Act, specifically for penetrative sexual assault and abetment due to the minor’s age.",

    "Passage": "This Civil Revision Petition arise against the order passed by the learned I Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, at Chennai in IA No.1 of 2023 in IDOP No.1921 of 2023 dated 01.12.2023. The Civil Revision Petitioner is the husband. The wife presented IDOP No.1921 of 2023 seeking for divorce under Section 10(1)(x) of the Indian Divorce Act. The petitioner married the respondent as per Christian rites and customs on 26.06.2013. From the wed-lock, a girl child was born to the couple. Thereafter disputes and differences arose between the parties. Alleging that the husband physically and verbally abused the wife and treated her with cruelty, the wife approached the All Women Police Station at Vepery. Finding that it was not fruitful, she presented the above original petition. Summons was served on the respondent, he has entered appearance. Pending the litigation, she took out an application invoking Section 36 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869. She sought for a direction to the husband to pay a sum of Rs.30,000/- to herself and her child and Rs.25,000/- towards maintenance. The husband filed a counter stating that the wife is a triple degree holder and she is working in an I.T. Company under the name and style of “Zoho”. He would plead that since she is earning a sum of Rs.45,000/- per month, she is not entitled to maintenance. Insofar as the litigation is concerned, he would state that the legal services authority is giving free legal aid to litigants and that the party could approach the said Authority for legal defence. Both the parties filed their affidavit of assets and liabilities as directed by the Supreme Court in Rajnesh v. Neha and another, reported in AIR 2021 (SC) 569. The learned Trial Judge came to a conclusion that the husband is earning around Rs.26,000/- per month and he is employed with CSS Corp Chennai as Technical Support. Therefore, she concluded that a sum of Rs.12,000/- i.e., Rs.6,000/- each to the petitioner and the girl child would be reasonable in the circumstances. Challenging the said order, this revision arise. Mr.P.Sankara Narayanan, learned counsel would plead that the learned Trial Judge did not take into consideration that the wife is earning more than the husband and therefore, she is not entitled for any amount. He would plead that he would take care of the interest of the child, but cannot maintain the wife, on account of the fact that she is earning more than him and also to the fact that he is suffering from physical ailments and has to take care of the needs of his aged mother. Hence he would plead that the revision deserves admission and an interim order. I have carefully considered the submissions of Mr.Sankara Narayanan. At the outset I have to remind myself that the Court sitting under revision under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, would not normally interfere with the order of interim maintenance, unless and until the amount is arbitrary, excessive or bordering on luxury to the respondent. The amount granted to both the parties is only Rs.12,000/-. This works out to about Rs.200/- per day. The parties are residence of Metropolitan City of Chennai. Therefore, the amount which has been awarded by the Court cannot be said to suffer from any of the aforesaid vices. Furthermore, the fact that the wife is earning does not mean she is disentitled to receive maintenance. In terms of Section 36 of the Indian Divorce Act, the wife is entitled to seek maintenance not only for herself but also for the child. The child is around eight years. Her financial demand will obviously be more than the paltry sum of Rs.6,000/- that has been fixed by the learned Trial Judge. It is not as if that the amount that is paid to the wife is going to be exclusively used by her. There is no dispute that the mother has the custody of the child and is attending to her day to day needs. Finding that the amount is not excessive, I am not inclined to interfere. The Civil Revision Petition is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is dismissed.",
    "Question": "What are the implications of the Court's ruling regarding maintenance in this case, particularly considering the roles of both parents and the financial circumstances described in this legal scenario? How might this influence future cases involving domestic abuse and maintenance disputes?",
    "A": "Future cases will likely ignore the income of the spouse receiving maintenance.",
    "B": "The ruling affirms that both parents’ financial situations must be considered when determining maintenance.",
    "C": "Only the parent's income contributes to the maintenance for the child.",
    "D": "The ruling states that maintenance is not necessary if either parent has income.",
    "Correct Answer": "The ruling affirms that both parents’ financial situations must be considered when determining maintenance.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage illustrates that despite the wife's higher income, the Court acknowledges her entitled right to maintenance for both herself and her child. This ruling sets a precedent emphasizing that maintenance orders should not solely depend on the earnings of one parent and reflects the continuous need for child support, regardless of parents’ income levels."

FIR came to be registered against the petitioner based on the information lodged by Smt.Gunasheela, attached to Child Line, Bengaluru. In the complaint, it was alleged that the victim was studying in VII Standard at Nehru Centenary English School, Kanakanagar, Bengaluru. The parents of the victim were separated for the past five years and her mother got remarried to the petitioner/accused and was residing at Kanakanagar. The mother of the victim was an alcoholic and after she went to sleep, the petitioner/accused used to sexually abuse the victim for the past two years and threatened her not to disclose the same to anyone. In the complaint, it was stated that the victim narrated her plight to her friends and as per their advice, she called the Child Helpline and reported the matter to the complainant.\n\n 2. Sri.Tomy Sebastian, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner contends that the victim in her statement given to the Magistrate under section 164 of Cr.P.C., has unequivocally stated that she was in love with a boy by name Sameer. Her father namely the petitioner/accused saw them and as she needed freedom, by mistake, her father was implicated. Learned Magistrate failed to consider this statement and has rejected the application filed by the petitioner solely on the ground that the offences alleged against the petitioner are severe and are punishable upto life imprisonment.\n\n 3. Learned HCGP appearing for respondent however opposed the petition contending that the petitioner is involved in a serious offence under the provisions of POCSO Act and therefore he is not entitled for grant of bail.\n\n 4. I have considered the submissions and have perused the records.\n\n 5. The offences charged against the petitioner are punishable under sections 5(n) and 6 of POCSO Act, 2012 and under sections 376 and 506 of IPC. In the statement given by the victim under section 161 of Cr.P.C., the victim has categorically implicated the petitioner herein and has stated that after her mother used to go to sleep, after getting heavily drunk, the petitioner used to sexually abuse her since the past two years. She has also narrated that she herself informed the matter to the Child Helpline through the mobile phone of one Smt.Priya, mother of her classmate. The complainant has also narrated that on getting the information over the phone, she visited the school where the victim was studying and on ascertaining that she was a victim of sexual offence, lodged the report before the D.J. Halli Police, whereafter the victim was subjected to medical examination and the accused was also arrested and subjected to medical examination.\n\n 6. The medical report produced along with the charge sheet indicates that as on the date of the examination of the victim, she was aged about 13 years. She had reached menarche. Her hymen was not intact. All these facts prima facie go to show that she was a victim of sexual assault. Unfortunately, in her statement given before the learned Magistrate under section 164 of Cr.P.C., the victim stated thus:\n\n \"I have come to the court with my mother. I will give statement in front of my mother. I am aware of Kannada language very little and I can speak English. It is my mistake, first of all I did love with one boy Sameer. My father saw. I needed freedom to meet that boy. It all my mistake. I saw in T.V. about Hyderabad i.e., about Priyanka. I am feeling guilty. Its all of my mistake please leave my father. My father nothing he did I wanted freedom to meet them. Hence, I said to the police like that. That's all.\"\n\n Though this statement is contrary to the previous statements made by the victim before the Police and the complainant, yet, solely on that ground, the petitioner cannot be enlarged on bail as he is otherwise not entitled to bail having regard to the inter se relationship and the manner in which the victim is alleged to have been subjected to sexual offence. Though in her statement recorded under section 164 of Cr.P.C., she has stated that she was in love with Sameer, there is no material on record to show that she was sexually abused by him. No doubt, learned Magistrate has not adverted to the statement of the victim recorded under section 164 of Cr.P.C., but there being other evidence on record, it is not proper for this Court to jump to the conclusion that the statement made by the victim under section 164 of Cr.P.C. is truthful and free of any force or coercion. The circumstances that drove the victim to make contradictory statements before the Police as well as before the Magistrate needs to be enquired into. Likewise, the facts and circumstances which made the victim to implicate her father also are required to be determined, which could be done only in a free atmosphere free of lurking threat, coercion or influence by the petitioner or any other close relatives of the victim.\n\n 7. Undeniably, the victim has been residing in the house of the petitioner/accused along with her mother. Under the said circumstances, if the petitioner is enlarged on bail at this juncture, possibility of the petitioner/accused threatening or influencing or prevailing upon the victim cannot be ruled out, which may prejudice the case of the prosecution and the possibility of ascertaining the actual truth will also be affected. Hence, I am of the view that until the victim is examined by the Trial Court, the petitioner cannot be admitted to bail.\n For the above reasons, the petition is rejected. However, having regard to the facts and circumstances narrated above, the Trial Court is directed to examine the victim as expeditiously as possible, preferably through Video Conference and in the event the victim stands by the statement made by her under section 164 Cr.P.C., the Trial court shall enlarge the petitioner on bail, on such terms and conditions as found expedient.\n\n Sd/-\n JUDGE\n\n Bss.",

Shah- Advocate for the appellant. Dr. Anjali Gyanani - Public Prosecutor for respondent/State. Heard on I.A. No.7003 of 2023, which is first application under Section 389(1) Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of appellant-Akhtar Khan seeking suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Appellant-Akhtar Khan stood convicted under Section 4(2) of POCSO Act and sentenced to undergo 20 years' R.I. with a fine of Rs.2,000/- and under Section 9 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and sentenced to undergo 2 years' R.I with a fine of Rs.1,000/- with default stipulations vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 15/12/2022 passed by Special Judge (POCSO Act), Shivpuri (M.P.) in Special Case No.124/2019. Present appellant so far has undergone incarceration of about 17 months in toto, as transpired during the course of hearing. Co-accused/Appellant No.1 in Criminal Appeal No.838 of 2023-Shakil Khan is the biological father of the prosecutrix as after the demise of his first wife and mother of the prosecutrix, he married to co-accused Shehnaz Bano. As per prosecution story, the prosecutrix claiming herself to be 14 years of age, on 20/09/2019, lodged an FIR to the effect that for the last 4-5 years since the time her mother expired, she was ill-treated by her step-mother Shehnaz Bano off and on. She, therefore, had left the house and started living with her grand-parents. Thereafter, on 1/1/2019, while she was staying with her maternal uncle's house, step-mother Shehnaz came there and against her wishes brought her back. Thereafter, she started searching for the match though she was not major. She manipulated her marriage (Nikah) with accused/appellant Akhtar and Farukh Khan had reduced in writing the process of Nikah. After so-called solemnization of marriage (Nikah), she was subjected to forcible sexual abuse against her wishes by Akhtar from 24/08/2019 to 28/08/2019. Thereafter, accused/appellant Akhtar called her grand-parents to the Kota Court and whereafter, signing of certain documents, she was given in custody of her grand-parents. Thereafter, she came back to her grand-parents' house from Kota. It is alleged that appellant Akhtar had also threatened the prosecutrix with dire consequences, if she divulged the factum of marriage and that of sexual abuse. In the aforesaid backdrop, the prosecutrix filed the complaint and the same was registered at Crime No.213/19. Based thereupon, investigation was set in motion. The Investigating Officer, upon collection of incriminating evidence, filed challan. The Special Court upon critical evaluation of the evidence placed on record convicted and sentenced the present appellant as aforesaid. Learned counsel for the appellant while taking exception to the impugned judgement submits that the prosecutrix in her statement before the Court has clearly stated that her date of birth is 11/10/2000 as recorded in Aadhar Card and therefore, she was major as on the date of incident. However, the trial Court in Para-20 of the judgement, ignored the same and relied upon her date of birth as per the certificate of the Municipal Corporation, Kota (Ex.P/10) as 11/10/2005. That apart, she has turned hostile and belied the story of prosecution. Shakil Khan, co-convict/appellant No.1 in Criminal Appeal No.838 of 2023, has already been admitted to suspension of sentence and grant of bail vide order dated 27.04.2023. On such grounds, learned counsel prays for suspension of sentence and grant of bail to the present appellant. Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor for respondent/State, while opposing the application supporting the judgment impugned submits that looking to the gravity of offence, no exception can be taken in the matter of suspension of sentence and grant of bail to the present appellant. Upon hearing learned counsel for the parties, though this Court refrains from commenting upon rival contentions touching merits of the case but regard being had to the fact that co-convict/appellant No.1 -Shakil Khan in Criminal Appeal No.838 of 2023 has already been admitted to suspension of sentence and grant of bail vide order dated 27.04.2023, the present appellant has so far undergone incarceration of 17 months in toto coupled with the fact that appeal is of the year 2023 and there is no likelihood of its early hearing in near future and therefore, in the obtaining facts and circumstances, we hereby extend the benefit of suspension of sentence and grant of bail to present appellant-Akhtar Khan. Accordingly, I.A.7003 of 2023 stands allowed and it is directed that the jail sentence of appellant-Akhtar Khan shall remain suspended during pendency of present appeal and he shall be released on bail, subject to verification of amount of fine being deposited and on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lacs only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. Appellant-Akhtar Khan is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court first on 13.09.2023 and on other subsequent dates as may be fixed by Office in this behalf. Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of disposal of the application for suspension of sentence and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal. Certified copy as per rules.

Dewas registered a missing person report and FIR bearing Crime No. 132/2021 for offence punishable u/S 363 of IPC with regard to missing of Mamta Bai, Divya, Rupali, Pawan and Pooja.

    "Passage": "Kerala High Court, Manikandan vs State Of Kerala on 14 July, 2020. The petitioner is the sole accused in SC No.585 of 2019 pending before the First Additional Sessions Court (Special Court), Palakkad. The case against the petitioner originated on registration of Crime No.466 of 2018 at the Pudunagaram Police Station for offences under Section 376 (2) (n) of IPC and Sections 6 r/w 5 (j)(ii)(I) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The allegation which led to the registration of the Crime is that the petitioner and the victim had eloped on 18.05.2018, when the victim was a minor and that, after marrying the victim, the petitioner had subjected her to penetrating sexual assault and had thereby committed the offences. The aunt of the victim, who had filed the complaint leading to registration of the crime has filed an affidavit stating that the victim, whose parents were no more, had eloped with the petitioner and had married him. A legal marriage was conducted on 08.12.2019, after the victim became major and the marriage was registered on 25.02.2020. One girl child is born out of the relationship between the petitioner and the victim and that the petitioner and the victim are living as husband and wife. The victim has also filed an affidavit reiterating the above facts and further stating that she has no subsisting grievance against the petitioner. It is stated that continuance of the harmonious marital life of the petitioner and the victim require quashing of the criminal proceedings. I heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioner has no criminal antecedent and that the affidavit seeking quashing of the proceedings was submitted on her own volition. It is submitted that, though the sexual relationship of the petitioner with the victim was immediately prior to the victim becoming major, the fact that the petitioner had married the victim after she became a major and that both of them are leading a harmonious married life, can be taken into consideration. I take note of the fact that both the petitioner and the victim are rustic villagers and that after eloping from their parental homes, had married and lived as husband and wife. Immediately after the victim attaining 18 years, their marriage was registered and they are leading a harmonious marital life. Moreover, in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, there is no possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction. As such, continuance of the proceeding will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab, Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another, there is no impediment in granting the relief. In the aforementioned peculiar circumstances, I deem it appropriate to allow the Crl.M.C, even though the offences alleged are under Section 376 (2) (n) of IPC and Section 6 r/w 5 (j)(ii)(I) of the POCSO Act. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed; the proceedings in SC No.585 of 2019 pending before the First Additional Sessions Court (Special Court), Palakkad, is quashed.",
    "Question": "In light of the judicial proceedings described in the case of Manikandan vs State of Kerala, what legal standards or principles do you believe inform the court's decision to quash the criminal charges associated with the POCSO Act?

    "Reasoning": "The passage suggests that the court's allowance of personal circumstances, such as the victim's marriage after reaching adulthood and her expressed desire for the criminal proceedings to end, reflects a broader legal principle aimed at preserving personal relationships and autonomy."

For Petitioner : Mr.M.Prabhu For Respondents : Mr.T.Senthilkumar Additional Public Prosecutor\n[Order of the Court was made by P.N.PRAKASH, J.]\nFor the sake of anonymity, the detenue in this case is referred to as “X”. It is the case of the petitioner that her sister “X” aged 19 years, was sexually abused, in connection with which, a case in Pudukottai All Women Police Station Crime No.1/2019 was registered on 01.03.2019 against the petitioner's mother and one Anbalagan, who is said to have abused the girl. During the course of investigation, it was found that “X” had conceived. However, the foetus was aborted and on the orders of the Child Welfare Committee, “X” was lodged in the third respondent hostel, where she continues to stay even now. Alleging that X is in the illegal custody of the third respondent, the present habeas corpus petition has been filed.\nToday, Mrs.A.Ramalakshmi, Inspector of Police, Ms.S.Nagapushpam, WHC 870, All Women Police Station, Pudukottai are present. Ms.A.Muthulakshmi, (Assistant), Annai Sathya Ammaiyar Memorial Home for Destitute Children, Nilaikundam, is present. “X” was produced before us. When we enquired “X”, she stated that she is doing her 12th standard and that she is not in the illegal detention of the third respondent. She further stated that she does not want to go to the petitioner and wants to continue her studies.\nThe learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the investigation in Crime No.1/2019 has been completed and a final report has been filed in Spl.C.C.No.25/2020 in the Special Court for POCSO cases, Tuticorin against the mother of “X” and Anbalagan and the case is ripen for trial. “X” should have to give evidence in that case and therefore, it would not be possible to shift her from the third respondent hostel or permit free access to her, because she could be intimidated and turned hostile. Therefore, we find “X” is not in the illegal custody of the third respondent for issuance of a writ of Habeas Corpus. However, we direct the second and third respondents to ensure that sufficient protection is given to “X” and that she testifies in Spl.S.C.No.25/2020 before the Special Court for POCSO cases. Accordingly, the Habeas Corpus Petition is dismissed.",

The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No.388 of 2018 of the Kilikolloor Police Station, registered under B' 354A of the IPC, B' 9(n) r/w. B' 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, and also under B'75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2015. 3. The de facto complainant is the mother of the survivor child, who is aged about 14 years and studying in the IX Standard. She alleged that her daughter was found missing on 11.6.2018 from school. A crime was registered under Section 57 of the Kerala Police Act, 2011. The minor child was traced out later. She disclosed that she was in love with a boy and she had eloped with him. She also disclosed that she has had an active sexual relationship with the said boy, who is aged 19 years. In the said statement, she also disclosed that the applicant herein, who is her step-father, has touched her breasts with sexual intent on more than one occasion. On these allegations, two Crimes were registered. Crime No.387 of 2018 was registered against her 19 year old lover under B'B' 366 and 376(2)(n) of the IPC and under B' 5(1) r/w. B' 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012. Immediately thereafter, the instant crime was registered against the applicant for sexually harassing the child. 4. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that he has been implicated as his step-daughter felt that he was responsible for the arrest and detention of her lover. As the child was quite young, the applicant herein along with his wife had strongly opposed the relationship that she had with the accused in Crime No.387 of 2018. It is contended that after the death of the father of the minor child about three years back, the applicant has married her mother and he has been caring and protecting the family. Finally, it is submitted that the applicant has been in custody from 12.6.2018 and prays that orders for his release be issued. 5. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who has opposed the prayer. It is submitted that the medical examination report of the child shows that she has been subjected to penetrative sexual assault by the 1st accused. It is further submitted that the child has unequivocally stated that the applicant herein had abused her on more than one occasions. 6. I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone through the case diary. It appears that the applicant herein has been residing with the family after marrying the mother for the past more than two years. Allegations have been levelled against him only after registration of the crime against the lover of the child. The contention of the learned counsel that he has been implicated for his exuberance in prosecuting the lover of the survivor cannot be ruled out at this stage. Furthermore, serious allegations are levelled against the 1 st accused. The investigation appears to have progressed much and in the facts and circumstances further detention in custody of the applicant may not serve any purpose. By imposing appropriate conditions, for safeguarding the interest of the prosecution as well as the protection of the minor child, the applicant can now be released. 7. In the result, this application will stand allowed. The applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond for Rs.1,00,000/-(Rupees one lakh only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court having jurisdiction. The above order shall be subject to the following conditions: 1). The applicant shall appear before the Investigating Officer on all Saturdays between 10 a.m. and 1.00 p.m., for 3 months or till final report is filed, whichever is earlier. 2). He shall not enter the limits of Kilikkolloor Police Station for a period of six months except for complying with the conditions of this order. If for any extraordinary reason the applicant requires to enter the limits, previous permission has to be obtained from the jurisdictional Court. 3). He shall not intimidate or attempt to influence the witnesses; nor shall he tamper with the evidence. He shall not contact the victim or her family members. 4). He shall not commit any offence while he is on bail. 5). He shall not leave India without the permission of the Court and if having passport, shall deposit the same before the Trial Court within a week; If release of the passport is required at a later period, he shall be at liberty to move appropriate application before the Court having jurisdiction. In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the jurisdictional Court shall be empowered to consider the application for cancellation, if any, and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law.

OTHER PRESENT: SRI.C.N.PRABHAKARAN-SENIOR PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 03.04.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bail Appl..No. 124 of 2019 ORDER Apprehending his arrest, petitioner seeks anticipatory bail under Sec.438 of Cr.P.C. He is alleged to have committed offences punishable under Sec.354 of IPC, Sec.8 of the PoCSO Act and Sec.75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act ( JJ Act for short). The police of Enathu police station in Pathanamthitta district has registered a case as crime no.1641/2018 against the petitioner. Prosecution case goes as follows: It all happened at around 1 p.m on 21.12.2018. The victim girl aged 16 years was returning from her school along with her friends. When they reached Karimpara junction, the petitioner who came on a scooter abused the girl. He caught her hand. When she objected, he slapped on her face twice. Heard Sri.K.Shaj, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri.C.N.Prabhakaran, the learned senior public prosecutor. It seems that Sec.75 of the JJ Act is out of question. Sec.75 provides punishment for cruelty to child. In order to attract Sec.75, the offender must be a person who is in actual charge of or control over the victim child. The prosecution has no such case. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that catching the hand or slapping on the face do not attract the penal provisions in Sec.354 of IPC. It is also alleged that Sec.8 of the PoCSO Act is not attracted inasmuch as the acts alleged against the petitioner do not fall within the ambit of the definition of sexual assault contained in Sec.7 of the PoCSO Act. It is also the submission of the learned counsel that there is no allegation against the petitioner that he touched any parts of the body of the girl specifically referred to in Sec.7. It is also his submission that catching the hand and slapping on the face cannot be termed as an act with sexual intent. It is too premature to have a positive or negative finding on the arguments of the learned counsel. But his arguments cannot be totally ignored or brushed aside. I do not consider the present case to be one where custodial interrogation of the petitioner is an absolute must for an effective investigation of the case. Considering all these matters, I am inclined to grant him bail. The application is allowed. If arrested in connection with crime no.1641/2018 of Enathu police station, the petitioner shall be released on bail, after interrogation, on his executing a bond for Rs 75,000/- (seventy five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the investigating officer. The petitioner shall co-operate with the investigation. He shall make himself available for interrogation if so required by the investigating officer. He shall report to the investigating officer between 10 am and 11 am on every Saturday for a period of three months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. The petitioner shall not intimidate or try to influence witnesses. He shall not destroy or tamper with evidence. The court having jurisdiction is hereby empowered to cancel the bail in accordance with law if any of the conditions mentioned above is violated. If the petitioner surrenders before the court concerned, this order will cease to have effect and the said court will pass appropriate orders as if this order has not been passed.

Hence, the case has been registered. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, learned Counsel appearing for the first respondent and the learned counsel appearing for the second and third respondent submitted that now, the petitioners and the second respondent/defacto complainant have settled the dispute between themselves amicably and the second respondent/defacto complainant is not willing to proceed further with the criminal case. Today, when the matter was taken up for hearing a joint Memo of Compromise was filed before this Court signed by the petitioners and the second respondent and their respective counsels. The petitioners and the second respondent/defacto complainant and the victim girl present before this Court, identified by Mr.P.Chellapandian, SSI, Jeyamangalam Police Station, Theni District, as well as by the learned Counsel appearing for the parties. This Court enquired both the parties, satisfied that the parties have come to an amicable settlement between themselves on their own voluntarily without any compulsion.

    "Passage": "Xxxxxx vs State Of Kerala on 6 February, 2025. IN THE HIGH COURT OF KERALA AT ERNAKULAM PRESENT THE HONOURABLE MRS. JUSTICE C.S. SUDHA Thursday, the 6th day of February 2025 / 17th Magha, 1946 CRL.M.APPL.NO.1/2022 IN CRL.A NO.907 OF 2022 SC 35/2017 OF THE (FAST TRACK) SPECIAL COURT, THRISSUR PETITIONERS/APPELLANT: XXX RESPONDENT/RESPONDENT: STATE OF KERALA REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROCECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, KOCHIN, PIN - 682031. Application praying that in the circumstances stated therein the High Court be pleased to suspend the sentence in SC No.35/2017 on the files of the Special Judge's Court (POCSO), Thrissur. If the sentence is not so suspended, the petitioner would be put to irreparable injuries and hardships. On the other hand, no prejudice will be caused to any of the respondent if the sentence is so suspended. This Application coming on for orders upon perusing the application and upon hearing the arguments of M/S.SARATH BABU KOTTAKKAL, REBIN VINCENT GRALAN, Advocates for the petitioner and of PUBLIC PROSECUTOR for the respondent, the court passed the following: C.S.SUDHA, J. -------------------------------------------------------------- Crl.M.Appl. No.1 of 2022 in Crl. Appeal No.907 of 2022 --------------------------------------------------------------- Dated this the 6th day of February 2025 ORDER This application under Section 389 Cr.P.C. has been filed seeking suspension of sentence of the applicant/accused in S.C.No.35 of 2017 on the file of the Special Judge's Court (PoCSO), Thrissur. He has been found guilty of the offences punishable under Sections 6 read with 5(l) and (m) of the PoCSO Act and Sections 342 and 376(2)(i) IPC. He has been sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment for the aforesaid offences. The sentences have been directed to run concurrently. The maximum period of imprisonment he will have to undergo is 20 years. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the applicant/accused that there are several inconsistencies in the statements as well as in the testimony of PW2, the victim, as well as PW1, her mother who had given Ext.P1 FIS. It is pointed out that the case of penetrative sexual assault is not supported by the medical evidence. It is also pointed out that there is no consistent evidence relating to the date of the alleged incident. In addition to the aforesaid aspects, it is also pointed out that the applicant/accused is a 75 year old man suffering from Hydrocele and Bradycardia and that he requires surgery. Earlier, he was granted interim bail for a period of one month for the purpose of undergoing surgery. However, as his blood pressure could not be brought under control, the surgery could not take place and hence on medical grounds also the suspension is sought for. The learned public prosecutor opposes the application and submits that the victim child, who was only 10 years old, has clearly deposed before the court that she was unable to recall the date on which the incidents of abuse took place. However, she has clearly deposed that on three different occasions, the accused herein had committed digital rape on her. This probably must be the reason why she was unable to recollect the exact dates on which the incident took place. The learned public prosecutor also draws my attention to the testimony of PW4, a consultant pediatrician, Sun Hospital, Thrissur, to substantiate the argument that the medical evidence is also there to support the prosecution story. Heard both sides. I was taken through Ext.P1 FIS as well as the testimony of PW2, the victim; PW1, the mother and PW9, the doctor who examined the victim child on 24/11/2016. Ext.P1 FIS is seen given by the mother on 24/11/2016. In the FIS, the allegation is that the incident of abuse took place on 22/11/2016. According to the testimony of PW1, the mother, the incident took place on 24/11/2016 and it was on the same day she had taken PW2 to the hospital as she had seen injuries on the private parts as well as a hair inside the mouth of PW2. However PW9, the doctor who examined the child on 24/11/2016 in Ext.P6 medical certificate records that there was no external injury. As far as the testimony of PW4 is concerned, it is seen that there are absolutely no records to support his testimony that he had examined the child sometime in November 2016. It is also brought to my notice that the victim child had stated in her 161 statement that the incident took place on 23/11/2016 whereas in her chief examination, her testimony was that the incident took place on 22/11/2016. This contradiction was brought out in her examination and proved through the testimony of PW6 and the same has been marked as Ext.D2. On going through the testimony of the material prosecution witnesses, I think that the learned counsel for the applicant/accused is justified in arguing that there are inconsistencies in the testimonies and that doubts arise from the materials on record. It appears that the applicant/accused has got a good arguable case and therefore in the aforesaid circumstances and on medical ground, the sentence of the applicant/accused is suspended till the disposal of the appeal. It is submitted that the fine amount has already been deposited before the trial court. Hence, the sentence imposed on the applicant/accused is suspended on the following conditions: i) The applicant/accused shall be released on bail on executing a bond for ₹50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the trial court; ii) He shall not in any way contact or attempt to contact the victim or family member(s) in any manner; iii) He shall not commit any offence(s) while on bail; iv) If the conviction and sentence of the applicant is upheld or even modified, the time during which he is so released shall be excluded in computing the term of his sentence as provided in Section 430(4) BNSS; v) It is also made clear that if any of the conditions are violated, the bail shall stand cancelled.

The prosecution case in short is that the petitioner/accused aged 62 years is a teacher in the Madrassa, where the minor victim girl aged 9 years used to attend religious instruction classes and that on 26.06.2019 at about 9a.m., the petitioner/accused had sexually abused the minor victim girl aged 9 years, while she is in Madrassa by kissing her face and hands and biting on her lips. In the FI Statement, minor victim girl has stated that on the day in question she was alone in the classroom and the petitioner had demanded her that she should come and sit on his lap and she refused and thereupon he had forced her to sit on his lap and kissed on her cheeks saying that she is his daughter and that he had bitten her lips and that he had lifted her churidar top and touched her stomach and tickled her, etc. and that thereby the petitioner had committed the abovesaid offences. Smt.Noorji Noushad, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has fervently urged that the petitioner is innocent of the allegations and that he happens to be the innocent scapegoat in the factional fight between the two factions of Sunni viz., AK faction and PK faction and that the petitioner is teaching in a Madrassa which belongs to one of the groups and that the petitioner has been victimized in the instant case, etc. Further the learned counsel for the petitioner would point out that though the incident is allegedly happened on 26.06.2019, the First Information Statement and the crime has been lodged only as late as on 06.07.2019 and the long and unexplained delay in the lodging of the crime will go to the root of the prosecution case as it affects the very credibility and believability. Per contra, Sri.Saigi Jacob Palatty, learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent-State would point out that the mother of the victim girl on coming to know about the incident which happened on 26.06.2019 had immediately complained to the President of the very same Madrassa, where the petitioner is teaching and that the police has now taken a statement from the said President of the Madrassa, who has stated that as a matter of fact the victim's mother had complained him on the very same day (26.06.2019) and that he had immediately authorized the Secretary of the Madrassa to conduct the internal enquiry in the matter. That the parents of the girl were patiently waiting for the action of the Madrassa authorities. That someone else who was interested in the welfare of the child had informed the matter to the childline authorities, which in turn led to the information being conveyed to the police, who in turn had taken the statement from the minor victim girl, which in turn has led to the registration of the instant crime and that the delay in this case cannot be said to be unexplained and serious and that in the light of the abovesaid facts and circumstances, the delay is satisfactorily explained, etc. Further that the petitioner has no case that the President of the Madrassa belongs to an opposite faction as the petitioner is teaching in the same Madrassa and the President of the Madrassa has given the above statement before the police about the information conveyed by the victim girl's mother on the same day itself. After hearing both sides and after careful evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the case, the following directions and orders are passed: (i) The petitioner will immediately surrender and personally appear before the Investigating Officer in relation to the instant crime, for interrogation purposes, without any further delay, at any rate by 9 a.m. on any day on or before 14.08.2019. (ii) The petitioner will fully co-operate with the Investigating Officer in the conduct of the above interrogation process.

Date of Institution: 11.12.2015 Date of Reserving judgment: Not reserved Date of pronouncement: 30.05.2017 JUDGMENT 1. In the present case, accused Fareem Beg S/o Mahboob Beg has been charged and facing trial for the commission of offences punishable under section 354 of Indian Penal Code (in short 'IPC') and section 10 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (in short 'POCSO Act'), 2012 r/w section 9 of the said Act on the allegations of outraging the modesty of a girl child, namely, V (real name withheld in order to conceal her identity), aged about 8 years and committing aggravated sexual assault upon her. 2. The FIR in question was registered on the complaint of Raju Yadav, the father of the victim girl, who in his complaint has alleged that on 23.08.2015 at 6.00 PM, accused Fareem Beg along with his two associates namely Naim and Sehzad misbehaved with his victim daughter, abused her and gesturing with her and when he objected to the same, he was threatened by accused and his associates. On the said complaint of the father of the victim, the present FIR was registered u/s 506/509 of IPC and section 12 of POCSO Act on 24.08.2015 and the investigation was commenced. 3. During course of investigation, counseling of victim girl was conducted by NGO Mehar Charitable Society through DCW and her statement under section 161 of Cr.P.C. was recorded and site plan of place of occurrence was prepared at the instance of complainant Raju Yadav. Statement of the victim under section 164 of Cr.P.C. was also got recorded. During further investigation, date of birth proof of the victim girl was collected and accused Fareem Beg was arrested on 13.10.2015 and was sent to judicial custody. However, subsequently he was granted bail by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi vide order dated 27.04.2016. Another accused Shezad had joined the investigation but no sufficient evidence against him was found and therefore IO kept his name in column No. 12 of the charge­sheet. The co­accused namely Faim @ Naim who is brother of accused Fareem Beg was evading and he is at large. NBWs against him were taken. On the basis of the statement of the victim girl recorded under section 164 of Cr.P.C, section 506/509 IPC and Section 12 of POCSO Act were added and challan was prepared under sections 354/506/509/34 of IPC and section 8 & 12 of POCSO Act and put up before the court on 11.12.2015 for trial against the accused Fareem Beg. 4. On 29.02.2016, after hearing the Ld. Defence Counsel for the accused Fareem Beg and the Ld. Special Public Prosecution, Charge for the offences punishable under sections 354 of IPC and. 5. The victim and the complainant, who is also father of the victim on whose complaint the present FIR got registered against the accused Fareem Beg, are the star and material witnesses of the prosecution, who could have proved the allegations levelled against the accused. But the prosecution has miserably failed to examine both the witnesses despite availing sufficient opportunities. The prosecution even could not trace out the victim and her father and they could not be served despite best efforts made by the prosecution. The victim girl though in her statement recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C. stated that she was playing at 6'O clock in the evening and at that time Naim, Fareem (accused in the present case) and Shejzaad came there. Naim caught her, Fareem caught and kissed her and put his both the hands in her panty and tried to open her pajama. She shouted loudly then her father came and they all fled away. She further sated that Fareem and Naim came to her father later and threatened him if he would make any complaint in this regard, they would kill her father. But the victim girl did not appear in the witness box to prove all these allegations. In the absence of testimony of victim and her father, no incriminating evidence has come on record against the accused. There is no other eyewitness to the incident. Rest of the witnesses are formal i.e. the counselor who counseled the victim, the principal to prove the age of the victim, DO to prove the registration of FIR, IO and the Ld. MM who recorded the statement of victim u/s 164 Cr.P.C. Hence, it will be a futile exercise to examine rest of the witnesses in this case, as none of them is an eyewitness to the incident. Continuing with this trial any further, will only result in wastage of time and resources, and there will be no impact on the result of this trial. Hence, the prosecution evidence is closed and the SA of the accused is dispensed with. 6. In the overall facts and circumstances of the case, there being no material or incriminating evidence against the accused Fareem Beg, he cannot be said to be guilty of committing the offences as charged against him and he is entitled to be acquitted. Accordingly, Accused Fareem Beg is acquitted of the offences punishable under sections 354 of IPC and section 10 of POCSO Act. 7. However, Fareem Beg is required to furnish bail bond under section 437A of Cr.P.C, which shall remain in force for a period of six months. 8. File be consigned to Record Room, after due compliance of provisions of section 437A of Cr.P.C. by Fareem Beg. Pronounced in the open Court (Balwant Rai Bansal) on 30th of May, 2017.

    "Passage": "State vs Rohit @ Sonu on 4 May, 2018 IN THE COURT OF SHRI BALWANT RAI BANSAL, ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE­01, SPECIAL COURT (POCSO), SOUTH, NEW DELHI CIS­SC No.530/17 FIR No.410/17 PS: Mehrauli In the matter of: State versus Rohit @ Sonu S/o: Sh. Ashok Chauhan R/o: House No.363, Firoz Gandhi Colony, Basai Road, Gurugram, Haryana. ............ Accused. Date of Institution : 23.09.2017. Date of Reserving Judgment : Unreserved. Date of Pronouncement : 04.05.2018. Accused Rohit @ Sonu S/o Sh. Ashok Chauhan has been facing trial for the commission of the offences punishable under section 6 r/w 5 of the POCSO Act 2012 and section 376 (2) of the IPC, on the allegations that, he committed rape and aggravated penetrative sexual assault upon the girl child (the victim/prosecutrix), namely, 'N' (PW1, whose real name withheld in order to conceal her identity), aged 16 years. The brief facts of the case are that on 23.06.2017, the prosecutrix came to the PS­ Mehrauli and made a complaint to the police that she was sexually abused by a boy, namely, Rohit @ Sonu by promising to marry her. She also alleged that she also got pregnant and when she disclosed this fact to Rohit, he suggested her to terminate the pregnancy and on his persistent advice, she ate hot things due to which, her pregnancy was terminated. She alleged that on 19.06.2017, Rohit made physical relations with her lastly and on 20.06.2017, despite her repeated insistence, he refused to marry with her. Making the said complaint, the prosecutrix prayed for legal action against accused Rohit. Thereafter, the site plan of the place of occurrence was prepared at the instance of the prosecutrix and accused Rohit was arrested. The prosecutrix and the accused were medically examined. The statement of the prosecutrix was also recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. During the course of the investigation, the age proof of the prosecutrix was also collected. After completion of the investigation, the charge­sheet was prepared and filed in the court concerned for the commission of the offences punishable under sections 313/376 of the IPC and section 6 of the POCSO Act 2012. Charge for the commission of the offences punishable under section 6 of the POCSO Act and section 376 (2) of the IPC was framed against the accused Rohit @ Sonu, to which, the accused pleaded not­guilty and claimed trial, and the case was proceeded for prosecution evidence. In the list of witnesses, the prosecution cited 16 witnesses, out of which, two witnesses, including the prosecutrix as PW1 and her mother as PW2, have been examined so far. It is submitted by Ld. Counsel for the accused that the prosecutrix who is the main witness of the prosecution has already been examined as PW1 alongwith her mother as PW2, who is the hearsay witness, and no other public witness remained to be examined. He submitted that PW1, who is the main and crucial witness, has not supported the case of the prosecution. The Ld. Counsel has submitted that since nothing incriminating evidence has come against the accused, therefore, to save the precious time and manpower and resources of the court, the further proceedings in the present case may be stopped, and the accused may be acquitted of the offences charged against him. On the other hand, the Ld. Special Public Prosecutor has opposed the contentions made by the counsel for the accused. I have considered the submissions made on behalf of both the parties and have gone through the record of the case. There are 16 witnesses cited by the prosecution in the list of witnesses, to prove its case. Out of the said 16 prosecution witnesses, two witnesses have already been examined, including the prosecutrix as PW1. It is pertinent to evaluate herein the testimony of PW1, who is the main and important witness of the prosecution, to decide the fate of the case. PW1, the prosecutrix 'N' (full particulars are mentioned at Sl. No.01 in the list of the witnesses and the name withheld in order to conceal her identity) deposed that on 19.06.2017, it was the birthday of Rohit and they had celebrated his birthday in her house and thereafter, they went for shopping. In the evening, after shopping, Rohit dropped her to her house. She was asking him to marry her but he was not giving the clear answer and therefore, a quarrel took place between them. On the next day, he did not pick up her phone and she went to the police station and told the police that she was having friendship with Rohit for the last 4 ­ 5 years and he is not picking her phone. She stated that police obtained her signatures on some blank papers. She deposed that Rohit did not do any wrongful act with her and they were only friends. She deposed that she has married with Rohit on 23.08.2017. PW1 (the prosecutrix) was cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor and during her cross­examination, she denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor. PW2, namely, 'S' (full particulars withheld in order to conceal the identity) is the mother of the prosecutrix, who also turned hostile. In her evidence, she stated that her victim daughter was having friendly relations with Rohit being the neighbour, and she did not tell about their relationship or that Rohit has committed any wrongful act with her. PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix) was also cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor, in which, she also denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor. As already mentioned, the accused has been facing trial for the commission of offences punishable under section 376 (2) of IPC and section 6 of POCSO Act. As per the case of the prosecution, the prosecutrix was raped by the accused since March 2015 till 19.06.2017, on several occasions, on the pretext of marriage, and also got pregnant, and the accused got her pregnancy terminated. PW1 (the prosecutrix) categorically stated that on 19.06.2017, on the day of the birthday of the accused, they had celebrated the birthday in her house and thereafter, they went for shopping. She stated that in the evening, after shopping, Rohit dropped her to her house. She also stated that she was asking him to marry her but he was not giving the clear answer and therefore, a quarrel took place between them, and on the next day when he did not pick up her phone, she went to the police station and told the police that she was having friendship with the accused for the last 4­5 years and he is not picking up her phone call. She categorically stated that the police obtained her signatures on some blank papers. She specifically stated that accused Rohit did not do any wrongful act with her and they were only friends. She stated that on 23.08.2017, she had married with the accused. In her cross­examination by the Ld. Prosecutor, she categorically denied the suggestion that in March 2015, at about 10:00am, when her mother had gone for job and her siblings were at school and she was alone, Rohit came to her house and he proposed her for marriage. She also denied the suggestions that thereafter, Rohit made physical relationship with her consent or that thereafter, she had also introduced Rohit with her mother or that Rohit also talked with her mother for their marriage and her mother had agreed for the same. She also denied the suggestion that on 05.01.2017, Rohit refused to marry her and told her that if she would pressurize to marry him, then he would defame her in her relations. PW1 (the prosecutrix) categorically denied the suggestion put by the Ld. Prosecutor that Rohit made physical relationship with her on the pretext of marriage after alluring and enticing her. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that Rohit has been making physical relationship with her for the last two years. She also denied the correctness of the suggestions that during the period December 2016 to March 2017, she also became pregnant and when she told the same to Rohit, he asked her to terminate the pregnancy or that on his persistent advice, she ate hot things due to which her pregnancy was terminated. She also denied the suggestion that on 19.06.2017, accused Rohit came to her house for celebrating his birthday and on the said day, he lastly made physical relationship with her. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that the site plan Ex.PW1/B was prepared by the police at her instance. As per the MLC report of the prosecutrix, the sexual assault history narrated to the doctor is 'consensual sexual intercourse with Mr. Rohit who promised to marry her, and the last sexual intercourse was held on 19.06.2017'. However, PW1 (the prosecutrix) also denied the correctness of the suggestion put by the Ld. Prosecutor that at the time of her medical examination by the doctor, she had told to the doctor that she had consensual sexual relationship with accused Rohit. On seeing her statement Ex.PW1/E under section 164 Cr.P.C., she voluntarily stated that she had given the said statement to the Magistrate on the advice of Priyanka Madam who was the police official, as she had told her that if she would not give the said statement, her marriage would not be solemnized with Rohit. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that she had told to the Magistrate all the true and correct facts voluntarily and on her own and not at the advice of the police official Priyanka. On the other hand, while evaluating the testimony of PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix), who is a hearsay witness, it reveals that she has also not supported the case of the prosecution at all, stating that her victim daughter was having friendly relations with Rohit being the neighbour, and her victim daughter did not tell her about her relationship with the accused Rohit or that Rohit has committed any wrongful act with her, and this witness was also cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor. In her cross­examination by the Ld. Prosecutor, PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix) denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor that her victim daughter had told her that she loved Rohit and wanted to marry him, or that on her insistence, her victim daughter told her that they had also made physical relationship with each other. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that on 20.06.2017, her victim daughter told her that Rohit and his family members are refusing to marry with her. She also denied having ever made statement Mark­PW2/A to the police. In view of the aforesaid discussions, particularly, keeping in view the testimony of PW1 (the prosecutrix), in my considered opinion, no useful purpose will be served by examining the remaining prosecution witnesses, as it will not affect the fate of the case. The other prosecution witnesses are formal witnesses, most of which are police officials. There is no medical and forensic evidence on record to prove the case of the prosecution that the accused had made physical relations with the victim. In these circumstances, continuing with this trial any further, will only result in wastage of time and resources, and there will be no impact on the result of this trial. Hence, the prosecution evidence has been closed and the SA of the accused has been dispensed with. In the overall facts and circumstances of the case and the aforesaid discussions, there being no evidence against the accused, accused Rohit @ Sonu is entitled to be acquitted, and accordingly, the accused is not found guilty of committing the offences punishable under sections 376 (2) of IPC and section 6 read with section 5 of POCSO Act, and consequently, he is acquitted of the said offences. However, Rohit @ Sonu is required to furnish bail bond in the sum of Rs.10,000/­ with one surety of like amount, under section 437A of Cr.P.C, which shall remain in force for a period of six months. The bail bonds are furnished and the same are accepted. File be consigned to Record Room, after necessary compliance. Pronounced in the open Court                              (Balwant Rai Bansal)       th on 04 of the May, 2018.                                      Additional Sessions Judge­01, Special Court (POCSO), South:Saket Courts: New Delhi.",
    "Question": "In the context of the trial against Rohit @ Sonu, how might the legal framework, including the POCSO Act, protect victims like N, who allege sexual abuse but later do not support their original claims? What measures can be put in place within this framework to ensure victim support and justice despite such recantations?",
    "A": "The legal framework can protect victims by providing counseling services, ensuring their voices are heard, and training law enforcement to handle sensitive cases.",
    "B": "The framework fails to protect victims who recant, leading to a lack of support and understanding for their plights.",
    "C": "There are no specific measures in the POCSO Act that assist victims who later retract their statements.",
    "D": "Victims should be forced to pursue cases regardless of their willingness to testify.",
    "Correct Answer": "The legal framework can protect victims by providing counseling services, ensuring their voices are heard, and training law enforcement to handle sensitive cases.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage illustrates the challenges faced by the victim, N, and highlights the need for a supportive legal framework that understands victim dynamics and offers ongoing support. The measures of counseling and guidance within the POCSO Act ensure that even if a victim recants, they receive the necessary support and protection they deserve."

    "Passage": "A 12-year-old girl, Maya, reports to her teacher that she is being physically abused by her stepfather at home. She has visible bruises and appears frightened. The teacher informs the school counselor, who then contacts child protection services. The caseworker visits Maya's home and confirms the abuse. Legal proceedings are initiated to remove Maya from the abusive environment.",
    "Question": "Once abuse is confirmed in cases like Maya’s, what further legal steps can be anticipated from child protection authorities?",
    "A": "The authorities might conduct a thorough investigation and assess the family environment.",
    "B": "No further action will be taken if the accused denies the claims.",
    "C": "Authorities will immediately file charges without assessing the child's needs.",
    "D": "The process will solely rely on the testimony of adult witnesses.",
    "Correct Answer": "The authorities might conduct a thorough investigation and assess the family environment.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage points out the confirmation of abuse; authorities typically must evaluate the ongoing risk in the environment and the needs of the child to initiate appropriate legal and protective measures."

    "Passage": "In reviewing the appeal submitted by Sh. Phool Singh regarding the dismissal of his application for recalling the child victim in court, the overarching principles of the POCSO Act were fundamental to the decision. The court asserted the importance of preventing child witnesses from undergoing repeated examinations, reinforcing the sensibility of supporting children in traumatic judicial circumstances. The court also considered the possibility of undue influence on the victim's family due to their involvement in testimonies against the petitioner, affecting the integrity of the cross-examination process.",
    "Question": "Analyze how the considerations of potential influence on the victim and her family may shape legal actions moving forward, especially under the laws protecting minors like the POCSO Act. How may these factors complicate the scenario for the petitioner?",
    "A": "The court's concern regarding influence means legal protections are sidelined for the benefit of the accused.",
    "B": "Potential influences are crucial to ensuring the integrity of the victim's testimony and the judicial process in line with the POCSO Act.",
    "C": "Influence does not have any weight against the rights of the accused, making the legal actions straightforward.",
    "D": "Family influences must always favor the defendant in all instances regardless of child protection laws.",
    "Correct Answer": "Potential influences are crucial to ensuring the integrity of the victim's testimony and the judicial process in line with the POCSO Act.",
    "Reasoning": "The need to prevent external influences emphasizes the POCSO Act's role in safeguarding child witnesses, ensuring that any forthcoming legal actions maintain the integrity of the victim's testimony amid family relations."

    "Passage": "The Criminal Original Petition has been filed to quash the First Information Report in Crime No.31 of 2024 on the file of the first respondent Police. The case of the prosecution is that the second respondent and the petitioner are husband and wife. Due to some misunderstanding, the second respondent/defacto complainant left her husband and daughter. Taking advantage of the same, the petitioner on drunken mood sexually abused the victim girl/daughter. Hence, the complaint. When the matter is taken up for hearing today, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the second respondent has lodged a complaint before the first respondent Police and on that basis, F.I.R. came to be registered in Crime No.31 of 2024, dated 22.07.2024 for the offences under Sections 11(1) and 12 of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, against the petitioner. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner as well as the learned counsel appearing for the second respondent submitted that now, the petitioner and the second respondent have settled the dispute between themselves amicably and the second respondent is not willing to proceed further with the criminal case. Today, when the matter was taken up for hearing a joint Memo of Compromise filed before this Court signed by the petitioner and the second respondent and their respective counsels. The petitioner and the second respondent present before this Court, identified by Ms.S.Bagavathy, WSSI, AWPS, Palayamkottai, Tirunelveli City, as well as by the learned counsels appearing for the parties. This Court enquired both the parties, satisfied that the parties have come to an amicable settlement between themselves on their own voluntarily without any compulsion. The second respondent had stated that she and the petitioner are husband and wife and considering their children' future, she intends to withdraw the complaint against the petitioner. She has also filed filed an affidavit. The relevant portion of the affidavit reads as follows: “ ............4. It is submitted that the petitioner herein is my husband, out of wedlock we have blessed with one male and one female child. During my matrimonial life some misunderstanding were arose between I and the petitioner. Therefore, I lodged complaint against the petitioner. Now by taking consideration of the future life of our children I and the petitioner amicably settle the entire issue without making any allegations each other. As a result, I show my intent to drop the criminal proceedings pending against the petitioner herein. In view of the same, I have no objection to quash the FIR in Crime NO.31 of 2024 on the file of the first respondent dated 22.07.2024.............”. The case has been registered for offences under Sections 11(1) and 12 of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. It is settled law that the High Court has inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the criminal proceedings even for the offences which are not compoundable under Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, where the parties have settled their dispute between themselves. However, while quashing the criminal proceedings, based on the settlement arrived at between the parties, the High Court should act with caution and the power should be exercised sparingly only in order to secure the ends of justice and also to prevent abuse of process of any Court. The legal position expressed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and another reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303 and Parbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Vs. State of Gujarat) reported in (2017) 9 SCC 641 were taken into consideration. Keeping the above principles in mind, let us now consider the instant case as to whether it is a fit case to quash the criminal proceedings based on the settlement arrived at between the parties. In the case at hand, though FIR has been registered for the offences punishable under Sections 11(1) and 12 of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, now, the petitioner and the second respondent have amicably settled their dispute between themselves. The second respondent has also filed an affidavit. The dispute between husband and wife has been magnified and stamped as an POCSO offence. The victim is minor daughter. Now, all are residing together as a family happily. In view of the compromise between the parties, the possibility of conviction is also remote and bleak. In the above circumstances, continuity of the criminal proceedings would only cause oppression and prejudice to the parties, hence, in order to secure the ends of justice, this Court is inclined to quash the criminal proceedings. Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed and FIR in Crime No.31 of 2024 registered against the petitioner on the file of the first respondent, is hereby quashed and the terms of joint compromise memo and affidavit filed by the second respondent shall form part and parcel of this order.",
    "Question": "How does the quashing of the FIR under the Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act in this case impact the potential legal options available for the victim child, particularly regarding her future protection and rights?",
    "A": "Quashing the FIR enhances the victim child's future legal protections.",
    "B": "The quashing of the FIR may limit the victim child's access to justice and future protection under the law.",
    "C": "Legal options are unaffected by the quashing of the FIR regardless of the allegations.",
    "D": "The victim child would be fully protected by the law irrespective of the proceeding's outcome.",
    "Correct Answer": "The quashing of the FIR may limit the victim child's access to justice and future protection under the law.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage indicates that while the court can quash the FIR based on reconciliation, doing so may hinder the victim child’s access to justice and reduce her ongoing protection under the POCSO framework."

    "Passage": "On 16.12.2013, the victim, a minor girl, aged about 17 years gave a written statement to the police, addressed to the DCP that about two years ago, Soni W/o Iliyas had met her with Suhail S/o Nabiullah. Suhail started talking with her on phone and also meeting her. On the pretext of marrying her, Suhail took her to the house of his brother Chhote Qureshi several times where he made forcible physical relations with her many times against her wishes. On her weeping and crying, accused Suhail took her to the house of Moni W/o Iliyas at Vasant Vihar where she was kept for about twenty days and with the help of Iliyas and Moni, Suhail again committed rape upon her on the false pretext of marriage. At that time she was about 17 years of age. When Suhail had met her with Moni, she was about 15 years and 6 months of age. When, she got rid of atrocities of Suhail, she asked him to let her go to her parents, otherwise she would commit suicide and that she could not believe that he would deceive her in such a manner and that whenever she got a chance, she would complain against him with the police. Thereupon, Suhail, Bade Qureshi, Chhote Qureshi, Akil Ahmad, Soiab, Moni and Iliyas, all favoured Suhail and gave her assurance to marry her with Suhail and she accorded to it in order to save her life and on 10.10.2013, her marriage/nikah was solemnized with Suhail before a court where her age was shown as 18 years in the marriage agreement, more than one year of her actual age.

At that time, she was carrying a pregnancy of about two months and that Bade Qureshi, Chhote Qureshi, Akil Ahmad and Suhail's sisters also started saying that they would not keep her and that Suhail had already left several girls like her and they could do nothing against him and if she tried to initiate any legal action against him, she and her family members would have to face consequences which she could not imagine. She further stated that they also came to her house and threatened her if she would not obey their commands, they would get her killed and they were in contact with bed elements. She stated that she belonged to a poor family and that is why they were ruining her life and were not keeping her with them.",

    "A": "Law enforcement should conduct an investigation to determine the truth of the victim's allegations and file appropriate charges.",
    "B": "The victim should be encouraged to forget about the abuse and move on.",
    "C": "No action is needed as the victim has survived her ordeal.",
    "D": "The victim should return to her alleged husband for reconciliation.",
    "Correct Answer": "Law enforcement should conduct an investigation to determine the truth of the victim's allegations and file appropriate charges.",
    "Reasoning": "Given the nature and severity of the allegations in the passage, immediate legal action is essential to prevent further harm and ensure accountability. Under the POCSO Act, law enforcement has an obligation to protect the victim and investigate thoroughly any claims of abuse and violence."

PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI.AMJAD ALI THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 12.10.2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ORDER This application is filed under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. 2. The applicant herein is the 1 st accused in Crime No.487 of 2018 registered at the Puthenvelikkara Police Station under Sections 376(2)(f)(l) r/w. Section 34 of the IPC, Section 3, 4, 5(n) and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. 3. The survivor in the instant case is the daughter of Sri.Madhu M.R., the elder brother of the applicant, who died on 26.11.2016 after a prolonged bout of illness. Sri.Madhu M.R. had divorced his wife in the year 2012 and thereafter, the children were allegedly residing with their father. After the death of Sri.Madhu M.R., a petition was filed before the Judicial Magistrate, Paravur by the survivor and her mother seeking a residence order under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The respondents in the said petition are the applicant and his aged mother. In the said petition, which was filed in the year 2017, among other allegations, it was stated that the child and her brother were residing with their father till his death. While her father was not at home, the applicant and his friends used to behave in a salacious manner and used to look at the child with lustful eyes. Though she used to complain to her grandmother, instead of reprimanding the 1st accused, the victim used to be physically abused. On these allegations, a prayer was made to permit her mother to reside in the parental home of the father of the victim. On receipt of the said application, the learned Magistrate noticed that the petition contained allegations of sexual abuse on a minor child and decided to report the offence as envisaged under Section 19 of the POCSO Act. On receipt of the said memorandum dated 4.9.2018, a Crime was registered as aforesaid. The statement of the child was recorded by the Sub Inspector of Police, Women Cell. In her statement, which was recorded on 6.9.2018, she levelled very serious allegations against the applicant. She stated that on October, 2016 while she was not at home, the applicant came and sat next to her and touched her body with sexual intent. She spurned his advances and went to her room. He is alleged to have entered her bedroom and subjected her to penetrative sexual intercourse. After committing the act, he left the room. According to the child, though she narrated all these aspects to her father, he did not believe her words. The applicant herein was arrested on 19.9.2018 and he remains in custody. 4. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that this is a classic case of abuse of provisions of the Act. In the petition filed seeking relief under the Domestic Violence Act, all that the child had stated was that the applicant used to behave in an inappropriate manner. She did not even have a case that the applicant touched her body let alone commit sexual intercourse. The learned Magistrate, thereafter considered the application and refused the prayer for a residence order. According to the learned counsel, the father of the child was extremely sick and neither the mother nor the children used to visit him. If there was any truth in the allegations, nothing prevented the mother or the child to level such allegations in the application filed before the learned Magistrate. The learned counsel has referred to Annexure-I petition filed under the Domestic Violence Act and Annexure-II order passed by the learned Magistrate. 5. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor and I have gone through the case diary. 6. It is borne out from Annexure-II order that the father of the victim had divorced the mother of the child in the year 2012. Annexure-I petition seeking a residence order is filed by the victim and her mother before the learned Magistrate. Nowhere in Annexure-I has it been mentioned that the child was raped by the applicant. The learned Magistrate had refused a residence order by order dated 7.3.2018. It is much later, on 6.9.2018, that an embellished version of the incident has been furnished by the child. In the 164 statement of the child recorded by the learned Magistrate, the child has reiterated the allegations. However, there are enough materials in the case diary which casts serious doubts as regards the veracity of the serious allegations levelled by the child against her uncle. The medical examination report also does not show that there is history of vaginal penetration. Furthermore, the applicant herein has been in custody from 19.9.2018 and in the facts and circumstances, I do not think that his further incarceration in custody is warranted. In the result, this application will stand allowed. The applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond for Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court having jurisdiction. The above order shall be subject to the following conditions: 1). The applicant shall appear before the Investigating Officer on every Saturdays between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., for a period of 3 months from today or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier. 2). He shall not intimidate or attempt to influence the witnesses; nor shall he tamper with the evidence. He shall not make any attempt to contact the victim or her family members. 3). He shall not commit any offence while on bail. 4). He shall not leave India without the permission of the Court and if having passport, shall deposit the same before the Trial Court within a week; If release of the passport is required at a later period, the applicant shall be at liberty to move appropriate application before the Court having jurisdiction. In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the jurisdictional Court shall be empowered to consider the application for cancellation, if any, and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law.

The Additional Public Prosecutor argues that the convict deserves maximum punishment to send a strong societal message against rising crimes against women. Meanwhile, the convict's counsel seeks leniency, citing the convict's age, family responsibility as the sole breadwinner, and that this is his first offense. Despite the conviction, the court decides to grant probation rather than imprisonment, requiring the convict to file a personal bond, report to a probation officer, and pay a compensation of Rs. 10,000 to the victim.",

    "Passage": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS DATED 03.07.2018 CORAM THE HONOURABLE Mr.JUSTICE P.N.PRAKASH CRL.O.P.No.16922 of 2018 and CRL.M.P.No.8740 of 2018 Damodaran .. Petitioner Vs State by The Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station, Ayanavaram, Chennai-23. .. Respondent Criminal Original Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C., praying to call for the entire records connected with the order in Crl.M.P.No.7906 of 2018 in S.C.No.226 of 2016 dated 21.05.2018 passed by the Mahila Court, Chennai insofar as dismissing the petition under Section 311 Cr.P.C. for cross-examination of PW2, PW8 and PW9 and direct the Mahila Judge, Chennai permitting the petitioner to cross-examine PW2, PW8 and PW9. For Petitioner: Mr.B.Janakiram For Respondent: Ms.P.Kritika Kamal, GA [Crl. Side] O R D E R This Criminal Original Petition has been filed praying to set aside the order dated 21.05.2018, passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Chennai in Crl.M.P.No.7906 of 2016 in S.C.No.226 of 2016. 2.Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government Advocate [Crl. Side] appearing for the respondent. 3.On the complaint lodged by Regina Mary that her six year old daughter[x] was sexually abused by the petitioner herein, the respondent Police registered a case in Crime No.9 of 2015 and after completing the investigation, have filed a final report and trial in S.C.No.226 of 2016 is pending on the file of the Mahila Court, Chennai for various offences under POCSO Act. Charges were framed against the petitioner/accused and the prosecution witnesses were examined. The victim girl-x was examined as PW2 on 09.02.2017. She was not cross-examined by the accused. The prosecution examined 11 witnesses, who were not cross-examined by the accused. After 1= years, the accused filed Crl.M.P.No.7906 of 2018 in S.C.No.226 of 2016 under Section 311 Cr.P.C. to recall PW1 to PW11, which has been partly allowed by the trial Court. Challenging which, the accused is before this Court. 4.On a reading of the impugned order, it is seen that the trial Court has refused permission to recall the victim girl-x [PW2]. But, whereas, the trial Court has ordered the recall of PW1, PW3 to PW7, PW10 and PW11. 5.Learned counsel for the accused submitted that a false case has been foisted on the accused and therefore, it is necessary for the accused to recall the victim girl-x and the two Doctors, namely, PW8 and PW9, who have examined the victim girl and the accused. He placed strong reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Mannan SK and Others Vs State of West Bengal and Another, wherein, the Supreme Court has held as follows: The second part of the Section uses the word 'shall'. It says that the court shall summon and examine or recall or re-examine any such person if his evidence appears to it to be essential to the just decision of the case. The words 'essential to the just decision of the case' are the key words. The court must form an opinion that for the just decision of the case recall or re-examination of the witness is necessary. Since the power is wide it's exercise has to be done with circumspection. It is trite that wider the power greater is the responsibility on the courts which exercise it. ... 6.This Court gave its anxious consideration to the rival submissions. It is true that power under Section 311 Cr.P.C. can be invoked at any time before the judgment is delivered, if it is found that the evidence of a particular witness is just and essential. In this case, the victim girl was examined on 09.02.2017. She was not cross-examined by the counsel. 7.Learned counsel for the accused submitted that the earlier counsel had bungled and therefore, on change of counsel, an opportunity should be given to recall the victim girl. Section 33[5] of the POCSO Act states that a child witness should not be called repeatedly to the Court for the purpose of examination. The idea behind this provision is that a child will suffer psychological trauma, if she is made to repeat the ordeal that was undergone by her. In this case, the victim is a nine year old girl. Proviso to Section 309 Cr.P.C. reads as follows: [b] the fact that the Pleader of a party is engaged in any other Court, shall not be a ground for adjournment. Thus, the statute says that just because the pleader of a party is engaged in another Court, that cannot be a ground for adjournment. It will be a travesty of justice to overlook Section 309 Cr.P.C. and Section 33[5] of POCSO Act and say that on account of change of counsel, the victim girl should be recalled. 8.As regards PW8 and PW9, they are Government Doctors, whose time is indeed precious. In Vinodh Kumar Vs State of Punjab reported in 2015[1] MLJ [Crl] 288, the Supreme Court has taken note of the pernicious practice that is prevailing in the trial Courts today, whereby no witness is cross-examined on the day they are examined in-chief, they recalled after several days and in the meantime, they are either intimidated or won over. 9.In Mannan S.K. case relied upon by the learned counsel for the accused, the prosecution wanted to recall the Investigating Officer, who had recorded the statement of the deceased at the scene of the offence. Since the statement of the deceased is relevant as dying declaration under Section 32 of the Evidence Act, the Supreme Court thought it fit, not to shut out such a valuable piece of evidence. 10.In A.G. Vs Shiv Kumar Yadav reported in 2015[9] Scale 649, the Supreme Court has stated that a petition under Section 311 Cr.P.C. cannot be allowed, on the mere asking even if the accused is in judicial custody. The reasons given by the accused to recall PW2, PW8 and PW9 does not pass muster, the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Vinodh Kumar's case and A.G. Vs Shiv Kumar Yadav's case. Under such circumstances, this Court does not find any infirmity in the order passed by the trial Court warranting interference and this petition stands dismissed. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.",
    "Question": "How do existing legal protections like Section 33[5] of the POCSO Act influence the judicial handling of cases involving child witnesses, particularly in relation to the rights of the accused to obtain evidence?",
    "A": "Such provisions grant the accused unlimited rights to question child witnesses.",
    "B": "These provisions establish a balance between the need for evidence and the protection of child witnesses.",
    "C": "Provisions like this eliminate the need for cross-examinations entirely in child witness cases.",
    "D": "Section 33[5] allows unlimited recall of witnesses regardless of the child’s emotional state.",
    "Correct Answer": "These provisions establish a balance between the need for evidence and the protection of child witnesses.",
    "Reasoning": "Section 33[5] of the POCSO Act demonstrates a legal framework that recognizes the vulnerability of child witnesses while ensuring that their protection from repeated trauma does not infringe upon the accused's rights to a fair trial and the ability to present evidence. This balance is essential in maintaining justice for both the victim and the accused."

Learned counsel for the applicant has argued that the applicant is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case. He has nothing to do with the said offence as alleged in the FIR.\n\n5. Learned counsel has also stated that the victim is the deponent in the instant application. The victim by her looks seems to be major. Learned counsel has also stated that a child has been born out of the said corporeal relationship and the victim has expressed her willingness to spend her life with the applicant.\n\n6. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length. There is no criminal history of the applicant.

In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and another vs Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others AIR 1980 SC 785, this Court has avoided detailed examination of the evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case as no party should have the impression that his case has been prejudiced. A prima facie satisfaction of case is needed but it is not the same as an exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself.\n\n9. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, and taking into consideration the settled law of the Supreme Court passed in Satender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors., 2022 INSC 690 and Manish Sisodia vs. Directorate of Enforcement, 2024 INSC 595 and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed.\n\n10.

In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail.\n\n12. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses.",

Respondent(s) For Applicants(s) : Shri Akshay Sail, Advocate For Respondent/State : Ms.Pragya Shrivastava, Dy.GA (Hon'ble Shri Justice Arvind Kumar Verma) Order on Board 25/03/2025 As the above three M.Cr.Cs. are arising out of the same Crime Number, they are being disposed of by this common order. The applicants have filed this bail application under Section 483 of the Bhartiya Nagrrik Suraksha Sanhita for grant of regular bail as they are in custody in connection with Crime No. 256/2024 registered at police station Mahasamund, District Mahasamund (CG) for the offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(n), 376(3), 506 Part-II/34 of IPC, Section 6 of the POCSO and Section 67 of the IT Act. Prosecution case in brief is that report was lodged against the applicants on 19.05.2024 alleging that the applicants took the prosecutrix to the doctor on 17.05.2024 as she was complaining of stomach ache and on examination, she was found pregnant. Thereafter on 18.05.2024, she was admitted at Aditya Hospital, Mahasamund for treatment. It is the case of prosecution that the applicant in M.Cr.C. No. 1463/2025 were having love affair and on 21.01.2024 they developed physical relations and the co-accused persons helped the applicant in the said offence. Based on the said report two more Crime Nos. were registered against two different persons namely Rajendra Sahu and Tulsi Sahu (Cr. Nos. 257/2024 and 258/2024) respectively. On the basis of the said report, the police registered the offence against the accused persons and they were arrested. Counsel for the applicants submits that the applicants have been falsely implicated in the case. He further contended that the FIR was lodged with a delay of about 5 months. It is contended that the incident took place on 19.01.2024 and 21.01.2024 whereas the FIR was lodged on 19.05.2024. It is contended that two more FIRs have been registered against two others of the same offence of sexual assault and therefore the testimony of the prosecutrix not credible and creates doubt as she has narrated different stories in her statements. It is submitted that the accused Rajendra Sahu in Crime No. 257/2024 has been granted bail by this Court in M.Cr.C. No. 6869/2024 vide order dated 08.01.2025, therefore the present applicants may also be granted similar benefit. It is contended on behalf of the applicants namely, Ashik Nishad and Ganesh Nishad in M.Cr.C. Nos. 1464/2025 and 1467/2025 receptively that they have only assisted the applicant Guman Nishad in the commission of rape. Lastly, it is submitted that the charge sheet has been filed, they are in jail since 20.05.2024 and the trial is likely to take some time, they are ready and willing to comply with any of the conditions which may be imposed upon them and thus, it is submitted that the application be allowed and the applicants be released on bail. Learned counsel for the respondent/State, on the other hand, has opposed the bail applications and submits that applicant Ashik Nishad in M.Cr.C. No1464/2025 had transmitted in the electronic form and made it viral. Heard counsel for the parties and perused the record. From perusal of the prosecution case, the accused Guman Nishad had developed physical relation with the victim, she became pregnant and thereafter when her parents came to know about the incident, the report was lodged. However, after the victim gave birth to a child and DNA test was done and as per the report, applicant was not the biological father of the child. Here in the present case, though the applicant had denied to have made any physical relation with the prosecutrix but considering the fact that it was not the first occasion when the complaint was made by the prosecutrix against the applicant for committing rape but in the same vein she made similar type of allegations against other persons also.

The revisionist, through his uncle, argues that he is an innocent child with no criminal background and the courts overlooked important factors regarding bail for juveniles under the Juvenile Justice Act. The gravity of the offence is not a relevant consideration for denying bail to a juvenile. The courts have failed to provide evidence linking the juvenile to potential danger or known criminals that would justify his detention. Hence, the need for proper assessment of the conditions set forth in Section 12(1) of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 is emphasized. The case highlights child protection laws and their implications on judicial decisions. The order dated 22.3.2023 allows the bail application with specific conditions for monitoring the juvenile's rehabilitation.",

    "Passage": "This is an appeal preferred under Section 14A(2) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, hereinafter referred to as the Act. The appellant is the accused in Crime No.45/2021 of Vellikulangara Police Station in Thrissur District. The case was registered on the basis of the First Information Statement given by the victim girl, who is only 11 years old, alleging offence punishable under Sections 354, 354A(1)(ii), 354A(1)(iv), 354B, 447 of the IPC, Sections 7 r/w 8, 10 r/w 9(m) of the POCSO Act and Sections 3(1)(w)(i), 3(1)(w)(ii), 3(2)(Va) of the SC/ST POA Act, 1989. The substance of the allegation is that the appellant had taken the minor girl to the terrace of his own house at Maramkode, made sexual advancements against her after trying to denude her. When the child had escaped from his custody and run away to her house in the neighbourhood, he chased her by trespassing upon their property and called her through the window. The appellant was arrested on 21.01.2021 and since then is in judicial custody. The application for bail moved before the Special Court was dismissed by the impugned order dated 09.02.2021. Notice was issued to the victim as provided under Section 15A(5) of the Act. On receipt of notice, a counsel has entered appearance for the victim. The learned counsel on both sides were heard. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, there is no allegation of any aggravated sexual offence against the victim, that she has not suffered any injury, investigation is almost over, that the appellant is in custody for more than 48 days, he has two small children and also to look after his mentally re-tarted sister. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the victim submitted that the father of the victim is no more, the victim is being maintained by her mother who is a housemaid; they reside about two kms. away, the mother goes for work after taking the child to her sister's house and the appellant is the neighbour of that house; after the incident, the child is in a very frightened condition; they are afraid of the appellant. The victim is a 11 year old girl. There are prima facie reasons to think that the appellant had made advances against the child with clear intention of abusing her sexually. The place of occurrence is the terrace portion of the residential building of the appellant. The victim is a contemporanean of the children of the appellant. It is patent, at least for the present, that he had approached the child with malicious and corrupt intention to ravish her. The learned Public Prosecutor is not in a position to state the stage of investigation. But it is evident that final report is not yet filed. In the said circumstances and having regard to the submission of the learned counsel for the victim, that they are in a very traumatic stage after the incident, it is not in the interests of justice to release the appellant on bail. The allegations and the gravity of the offence also desist the Court from considering the application for bail at this stage. The learned Special Judge has dismissed the application for bail, taking into consideration all relevant aspects. There is no reason to interfere with the order. The appeal is dismissed.",

For Petitioner : Mr.M.Prabhu For Respondents : Mr.T.Senthilkumar Additional Public Prosecutor\n[Order of the Court was made by P.N.PRAKASH, J.]\nFor the sake of anonymity, the detenue in this case is referred to as “X”. It is the case of the petitioner that her sister “X” aged 19 years, was sexually abused, in connection with which, a case in Pudukottai All Women Police Station Crime No.1/2019 was registered on 01.03.2019 against the petitioner's mother and one Anbalagan, who is said to have abused the girl. During the course of investigation, it was found that “X” had conceived. However, the foetus was aborted and on the orders of the Child Welfare Committee, “X” was lodged in the third respondent hostel, where she continues to stay even now.

Ms.A.Muthulakshmi, (Assistant), Annai Sathya Ammaiyar Memorial Home for Destitute Children, Nilaikundam, is present. “X” was produced before us.

Therefore, we find “X” is not in the illegal custody of the third respondent for issuance of a writ of Habeas Corpus.

Respondent (By Sri Sheshadri Jaishankar, HCGP) This Criminal Appeal is filed under Section 374(2) of the Cr.P.C., praying to set aside the judgment and sentence dated 19.10.2015 and 21.10.2015 passed by the special judge and II Addl. Sessions Judge, Vijayapur, at Vijayapur in Special Case (POSCO) No. 21/2014, and acquit the appellant in the said case. This appeal is coming on for admission this day, the Court delivered the following: JUDGMENT The accused in Special Case (POCSO) No.21/2014 on the file of II Addl. Sessions Judge, Vijaypur has come up in this appeal challenging the order of conviction and sentence. In the proceedings before Session's Court, charge sheet was filed against the appellant herein for the offence punishable U/Sec.3(a) (b), 4, 5(m) and 6 of Protection of the Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and U/Sec.376(f) of Indian Penal Code. The aforesaid charge sheet is filed based on a complaint wherein it is stated that on 6.1.2014 appellant herein is said to have sexually abused victim girl CW-4 namely Sujata who is aged about 8 years and resident of Ingalagi Tanda. On the ill-fated day when she had gone to attend nature call at about 6.15 p.m., in the evening, by luring the said child with chocolates and biscuits accused forcibly took her into the field of one Kulkarni wherein Jawar crop was standing. The accused is said to have made the child to lay on the ground, removed her under garment and slept on her. It is also accused that he inserted his finger into her vagina, pressed in it and bit her lips and subsequently committed rape on her. A complaint was filed in this behalf, wherein, investigation was conducted and thereafter charge sheet was filed and the matter was committed to Sessions wherein cognizance for the offence was taken on 18.7.2014. After the charges are framed, same was read over to him. Since he pleaded not guilty, matter was taken up for trial. On behalf of prosecution, in all 17 witnesses are examined and 26 documents are marked. The material objects produced at MOs-1 to 5 are also taken into consideration. In the Court below, P.Ws.6 and 8 are the parent of victim girl. It is seen that P.Ws.9, 10, 11 and 12 have turned hostile and did not support the prosecution. Even P.Ws.1 and 7 panch witnesses to the spot panchanama Ex.P-1 and seizure panchanama Ex.P-2 except admitting their signature on said panchanamas, they have not supported the case. Therefore, in the Court below, they were treated as hostile witnesses and they were subjected to cross examination by prosecution. It is seen, in this proceedings that even the complainant - father of victim himself has turned hostile. However, after he was subjected to cross examination, the learned Session's Judge was able to elicit from him and as well as other witnesses that the injuries suffered by the child P.W.2 Sujata to her private part is not due to fall in the field and it is due to heinous act committed by the accused. On going through the judgment impugned, it is clearly seen that the prosecution and learned Sessions Judge has taken enormous strain to see that the truth is elicited from the victim as well as her family members to reconstruct the whole incident to bring the guilt of accused to the books, when all of them conspired together to bury the truth either for fear of shame in the society or fearing retaliatory action from the accused. On giving careful consideration to the entire judgment of the Court below, one thing is clear that the manner in which the entire prosecution has sought to be suppressed not only by the witnesses but also by the family members considering the future of the victim girl who is aged about 8 years, this Court is sympathetic to the family of the victim who have not supported the prosecution, who have given false evidence against the interest of their own child who is victim of sexual abuse. In any event, with proper appreciation of material on record, the Session's Court has been able to bring the accused to books and convict him for the offences punishable under the aforesaid provisions. On careful consideration of the judgement impugned as well as the material available in the form of evidence of the witnesses more particularly their cross examination, it is clearly seen that no grounds are made out by the accused in Spl.Case (POCSO) No.21/2014 to convert the finding of Session's Court in the aforesaid judgment to convert the conviction to an acquittal and also to disturb the sentence imposed on him. In fact this Court feels that considering the nature of offences, the punishment imposed is liberal one. In any event, since there is no appeal on behalf of the prosecution challenging the sentence disturbing the sentence does not arise. Accordingly, this appeal filed by the accused is hereby dismissed.",

Tomar, learned Public Prosecutor for the respondent - State.\nHeard on I.A. No.15174/2023, which is first application under Section 389(1) of Cr.P.C. moved on behalf of appellant No.1 - Child IN Conflict with law seeking suspension of sentence and grant of bail.\nAppellant stands convicted under Section 450 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 05 years RI with fine of Rs.500/-, under Section 328 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 05 years RI with fine of Rs.500/- and under Section 6 of POCSO Act read with Section 376(D) of IPC and sentenced to undergo 20 years' RI with fine of Rs.50,000/- with default stipulation vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 01.08.2023 passed by the Special Judge (POCSO Act), Bhind (Madhya Pradesh) in Special Case (ST No.) No.80/2021. As per prosecution story, while parents of the prosecutrix had gone away to attend a marriage, her brother and sister were sleeping on the terrace and she was sleeping in the courtyard on the ground floor, on 11.05.2019, at about 12 in the intervening night, accused - Jitendra, Rohit and present appellant (juvenile) entered the house from terrace area and caught hold the prosecutrix. She was dragged in a room, where she was forced to consume liquor, while present appellant-(juvenile) and another accused were standing outside the room. Main accused Jitendra committed rape on the prosecutrix. Accordingly, case has been registered. Upon filing of challan, the case was committed for trial to the Sessions Court. The Sessions Court upon critical evaluation of the evidence placed on record has convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred above. Learned counsel for the appellant at the first instance fairly submits that the appellant (juvenile) has already suffered the jail incarceration for almost three years. There is no allegation of either violating the personal liberty of the prosecutrix or committing rape. Instead, the sole allegation against him is that he entered the house and was standing outside the room, where she was sexually abused by the main accused Jitendra. As such the conviction of the appellant under Section 376(D) of IPC and 5(G) and 6 of POCSO is fully unwarranted and based on surmises and conjecture. The appellant even otherwise, has no criminal antecedents. It is further submitted that co-accused Rohit has already been granted bail by this Court and the case of the present appellant is akin to his case. Hence, prays for suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent-State opposes the application supporting the order impugned with the submission that the appellant and two accused persons had entered the house of the prosecutrix with common intention of commission of rape. The active participation is well specific from the story of the prosecution and the evidence placed on record during trial. Hence, no exception can be taken in the matter of suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Upon hearing counsel for the parties, though this Court refrains from commenting upon rival contentions touching merits of the matter but looking to nature of allegation and since the appellant is having no criminal record, the application deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, we allow the application and it is directed that the jail sentence of the appellant - (juvenile) shall remain suspended and he be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court subject to verification of factum regarding deposit of fine amount. Appellant is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court on 23.11.2023 and on other subsequent dates as may be fixed in this behalf with following further conditions:- (i) the concerned jail authorities are directed that before releasing the appellant, the medical examination of the appellant be conducted through the jail doctor and if it is prima facie found that she is having any symptoms of COVID-19, then the consequential follow up action or any further test required be undertaken immediately. If not, appellant shall be released on bail in terms of the conditions imposed in this order ; (ii) violation of conditions, State is free to apply for cancellation of bail. Accordingly, I.A. No.15174/2023 stands allowed and disposed of. Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of deciding the instant I.A. and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal.",
    "Question": "What arguments can be raised by the juvenile appellant to contest his conviction related to the POCSO Act and IPC in the case against him? How does the court view his participation in the crime in terms of legal remedies for juveniles?",

The allegation is, the 1st petitioner married the complainant, now aged 17 years while she was 15 years of age. The marriage was celebrated on the Basava Jayanthi festival of 2015 and one year after the marriage, the complainant joined the husband and in-laws in the matrimonial home during April 2016. One month thereafter, the 2nd petitioner/mother-in-law used to complain against the complainant with her son and the 1st petitioner used to beat her. He used to come home in drunken condition, abuse her filthily and assault her. They harassed her to get away from the matrimonial home. When she was carrying pregnancy for three months, she was assaulted in the presence of her mother and thrown out of the matrimonial home. Her mother is a daily wager and since unable to maintain her, admitted her to Nirmala Hospital, Shivamogga, where she was provided shelter. The Doctor on coming to know her age as 17 years, took her to District Child Welfare Committee. She was in the Shelter Home and thereafter admitted to Mecgan Hospital, Shivamogga, for delivery. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners are from Sillekyathar community and child marriage is very common in their community. They are not aware of the legal impediment against child marriage. They are nomadic people. If the petitioners are arrested, in all probability, it will shut the door of compromise for ever. The offence invoked is under Section 10 of the POCSO Act which attracts punishment ranging between 3 years to 7 years. The sensitive question of child born from the marriage between the victim and 1st petitioner cannot be lost sight of. Though the complainant was a minor at the time of the marriage, it is not a marriage void-ab-initio, it is a voidable marriage.

The petitioners are granted anticipatory bail for a period of three weeks in Crime No.47/2017 registered by the respondent police.",

    "Passage": "Abdulla Ainulhaq Ansari vs The State Of Maharashtra And Anr on 16 December, 2021. This Appeal is directed against the judgment dated 10th October, 2019 in Special Case No. 211 of 2015. By the impugned judgment, the learned Addl. Sessions Judge & Special Judge, City Civil & Sessions Court, Borivali Division, Dindoshi, Mumbai has convicted the Appellant for offences under Section 376(2)(f) and 506 of Indian Penal Code and under Section 5 (n) r/w. Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and one of Rs.5000/- I.d. rigorous imprisonment for 3 months for offence under Section 376(2)(f) of IPC; rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and fine of Rs.5000/- i.d. simple imprisonment for 3 months for offence under Section 5(n) r/w. 6 of POCSO Act; and rigorous imprisonment for one year for offence under Section 506 of IPC. The Appellant (hereinafter referred to as 'the Accused') is the father of the prosecutrix (PW2). The prosecutrix along with her siblings, parents and grand parents was residing at Zore Chawl, Mahatma Kabir Road, Vile Parle, Mumbai. Some time in the year 2013, the prosecutrix was housed in Dongri Bal Sudhar Griha in connection with theft of a laptop. About a month later, the accused brought her home. Some days later, she ran away from home and was seen loitering at Kalyan Railway Station. She gave fake name to the police on duty at Kalyan Railway Station. She was produced before the Committee. She was sent to Bhivandi Bal Sudhar Griha (Children's Home) and four months later, she was shifted to Dongri Bal Sudhar Griha. In September, 2015, PW2 informed the Child Welfare Committee that the accused had subjected her to sexual abuse. Hence, by letter dated 08.09.2015, the Chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee directed the police to record the statement of the prosecutrix. Accordingly, PW5- Madhavi Kadav recorded the statement of the prosecutrix (PW2) pursuant to which FIR came to be registered against the Accused for offences under Section 376 (1)(ii) , 506 of IPC and Section 6 of POCSO Act. PW5 referred the prosecutrix for medical examination, she conducted spot panchanama, arrested the accused and handed over further investigation to PW6- Sudhir Ghosalkar. PW6 requested the Magistrate to record the statement of the prosecutrix under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. He also referred the accused for medical examination and recorded the statement of the other witnesses and filed the charge sheet upon completion of investigation. The Accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and claimed to be tried. Prosecution in support of its case examined 6 witnesses. Statement of the accused was recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. The defence of the accused was that of total denial. He has stated that the prosecutrix always used to run away from home. He objected to the same as he did not approve of the same. He claims that sometimes he used to beat her and hence she has lodged false complaint against him. The Accused has examined his wife as DW1. After evaluating the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the learned Judge has held that the evidence of the prosecutrix amply proves that the Accused herein had subjected her to rape. Hence, relying upon the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, the learned Judge held the Accused guilty of offence under section 376(ii)(f) of the IPC and section 5(n) of POCSO Act, 2012 and sentenced him as stated above. Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence, the accused has preferred this Appeal under Section 374 of Cr.P.C. The evidence of PW2 reveals that she was housed in Bal Sudhar Griha for theft of a laptop. About a month later, the accused brought her home. She has deposed that the accused did not allow her to leave the house and used to beat her. She therefore ran away from the house, but the accused brought her back and assaulted her and cut her hair. The evidence of this witness is not reliable and trustworthy. She has not emerged as a truthful witness and has not passed the test of a 'sterling witness' and hence no conviction can be based on the uncorroborated testimony of PW2. The trial Court has based the conviction on conjectures and surmises, which are not well founded. Hence the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. Under the circumstances, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. The accused is acquitted of offences under Section 376(2)(f) and 506 of Indian Penal Code and under Section 5 (n) r/w. Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). His bail bond stands discharged.",

Upon recovery, evidence indicated that the prosecutrix had established a consensual relationship with the appellant, who was only 19 years old at the time. The crux of the case revolves around the determination of the prosecutrix's age and whether her consent was valid given her claimed minority.",
    "Question": "In the case of Shyam Singh vs State, can the appeal succeed based on the argument regarding the prosecutrix's consent and her age at the time of the alleged incident, especially in light of the POCSO Act and previous legal precedents? What legal protections are in place under the POCSO Act for minors whose consent is claimed and how do these protections apply in this case? Explain your reasoning.",
    "A": "Yes, the appeal can succeed as her consent was a critical factor in the prosecution's failure.",
    "B": "No, because the POCSO Act strictly prohibits any sexual interaction with minors, regardless of consent.",
    "C": "The appeal is unlikely to succeed due to established laws that do not recognize any consent from minors as valid.",
    "D": "Yes, if the evidence shows convincing lack of coercion and the consent of the minor was established.",
    "Correct Answer": "Yes, if the evidence shows convincing lack of coercion and the consent of the minor was established.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage indicates that the prosecutrix stated that her relationship with the appellant was consensual, and that she actively chose to stay with him. Thus, if her age could not be definitively established as below 18 years and her testimony supports the presence of consent, the court may consider these factors, in line with existing legal principles surrounding adolescent relationships and consent."

    "Passage": "The instant writ petition has been filed by the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) challenging the constitutional validity of Sections 23(1) and 23(2) of the Pre­conception and Pre­natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994 and seeking direction in the nature of certiorari/mandamus for decriminalising anomalies in paperwork/record keeping. The Society contends that the Act was meant to prohibit pre­natal diagnostic techniques leading to female foeticide. Despite this, the Child Sex Ratio has not improved significantly, and the Act is being implemented more in letter than in spirit. The Society argues that the ambiguous wording of Section 23(1) leads to grave injustices, equating clerical errors with serious offences such as sex determination. The inherent weakness in the law has resulted in proper doctors facing harassment without actual evidence of misconduct. Furthermore, Section 23(2) allows for the indefinite suspension of a doctor’s registration based on preliminary findings, assuming guilt prior to any conviction, violating the fundamental right to a fair trial as guaranteed by Article 21. The Act's presumption of innocence is a cardinal principle that should not be abandoned. In light of this, the Society seeks clarity on how best to address these discrepancies, positing that minor clerical errors should not lead to such drastic measures against medical practitioners.",

Petitioner\n(By Sri M.S.Kinikeri, Advocate)\nAnd:\nThe State through\nMahila P.S., Kalaburagi\nRepresented by Public Prosecutor\nHigh Court Bench, Kalaburagi\n... Respondent\n(By Sri Prakash Yeli, Addl. SPP.)\nThis Criminal Petition is filed under Section 439 of Cr.P.C., praying to enlarge the petitioner on bail in Spl. Case NO.12/2017 in Crime No.73/2016 of Mahila Police Station,\nKalaburagi, which is registered for the offences punishable under Sections 363, 376(2)(n) of IPC and Sections 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12 of POCSO Act and also Section 10 of Child Marriage\nRestraint Act. Brief facts leading to filing of the complaint are that, on 20.04.2016 at about 7.00 p.m. as the complainant was in her house and there was nobody in the house, petitioner came to the house of the victim, threatened and kidnapped her and thereafter he took her to his uncle's house at Kalaburagi. On 02.05.2016, the sister of the accused Roopa, Mahadevi and uncle Sharanappa all together took her to Nagavi Yallamma temple at Chittapur Taluka and there they solemnized the marriage of the victim with accused forcibly. Thereafter, accused kept the victim girl in his house at Kalaburagi and there he forcibly had sexual intercourse with her and the mother of the accused also helped the accused by way of abusing him to keep her in the house. It is further alleged that accused used to sexually harass her and used to have forcible sexual intercourse with her. With the help of others, she escaped and subsequently on 14.12.2016 she filed a written complaint. On the basis of the said complaint, a case has been registered against the accused persons. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Additional State Public Prosecutor appearing for respondent-State. The main grounds urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner are that the complaint is baseless and there is a delay in filing the complaint. The said complaint has been filed only with an intention to harass the petitioner. It is also contended that no marriage as alleged in the complaint has been taken place. It is also contended that already charge-sheet has been filed and the remaining accused persons have not been shown as accused. It is further contended that the medical certificate reveals that there is no offence as alleged in the complaint and there are no external injuries found on the victim girl. It is further contended that if the petitioner is detained in custody, it is going to affect his right. Further, it is contended that the petitioner is the permanent resident of Kalaburagi and he is the sole earning member. Further, it is contended that if the petitioner is released on bail, he is ready to abide by the conditions to be imposed by this Court and ready to offer sureties. On these grounds, he prays for allowing the petition. On the contrary, learned Additional State Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent-State would contend that the petitioner by kidnapping the victim, forcibly got married and thereafter he had sexual assault on a minor girl, who is aged about 16 years. He would also contend that the victim girl has given statement before the Magistrate and the same has been recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. and the learned Magistrate has also been shown as a party to the witness. He would further contend that in the statement of the victim, she has been categorically deposed that the petitioner has threatened and thereafter he had sexually assaulted her. He would further contend that because of the threat and other things the complaint was filed belatedly. At this juncture, if the petitioner is released on bail, he may tamper with the prosecution witnesses, he may abscond and he may not be available for trial. On these grounds, he prays for dismissal of the petition. I have gone through the copy of the complaint and other material produced along with the petition. By going through the contents of the complaint and other material, it indicates that the petitioner had kidnapped the victim on 20.04.2016, thereafter he got married her forcibly on 02.05.2016 and thereafter by threatening her he harassed her sexually and had a sexual intercourse with her. If the medical certificate is perused, it indicates that there is sexual assault has been made on the victim girl. Though the learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that there are no external injuries and other signs of sexual assault, but by going through the statement of the victim recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. and the medical certificate, they corroborate with the sexual assault committed by the petitioner. When the petitioner has committed a sexual assault on a minor girl, under such circumstances, the said offence is considered to be serious and he does not deserve any consideration. As such, the bail petition stands dismissed. However, since the petitioner is in custody, the Trial Court is directed to expedite the matter.",

DVC.No.11 of 2021 has been presented by the respondents as against the civil revision petitioner. There is no dispute in the relationship between the parties. The petitioner married the first respondent on 06.02.2014 at Chengalpet. From the wedlock, the second respondent was born on 04.09.2016. The first respondent alleged that the petitioner never used to lend an ear to the troubles that the first respondent was facing or gave her any financial solace during the time they were living together. She would plead that the civil revision petitioner wanted only a boy child, but since a girl child had been born, and that too with health complications, he had forsaken/deserted the mother and child. Therefore, she had presented the Domestic Violence Petition. On being served with the petition, the husband moved an application invoking the provisions of Order VII Rule 11. The learned Judicial Magistrate, on perusal of the complaint, came to the conclusion that the cause of action exists and therefore, dismissed the application on 04.01.2023. On appeal, the appeal was dismissed on 23.08.2023. Aggrieved by the same, the present revision has been filed. The wife did not seek any relief under Section 18(1) of the Domestic Violence Act and therefore, she is not entitled to maintain the petition. However, it is argued that under Section 12 of the Act, an application can be filed by an aggrieved lady to claim one or more reliefs. Each relief under Sections 18 to 22 are independent and can be claimed. A reading of the complaint shows there has been verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. Hence, the complaint is maintainable.

He was convicted as per\nthe impugned judgment for an offence punishable under Section\n376 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). He was sentenced to\nundergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to\npay a fine of Rs.10,000/-. 2. The prosecution was initiated with the following allegations: At about 10.00 p.m. on 08.09.2008 the accused committed rape on his daughter, PW1, aged 13 years at the house of his elder brother situated at Edapatta. He repeated committing rape on her at their house having door No.III/35 of Ponmala panchayat. It recurred till the last week of February 2009. Consequently, PW1 became pregnant and delivered a girl child at the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode on 03.05.2009. 3. On the appellant denying the charge, the prosecution has examined PWs.1 to 7 and proved Exts.P1 to P14. MOs.1 to 4 were identified. When questioned under Section 313(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Code), the appellant denied the incriminating circumstances. He filed a statement setting out his defence. He stated that he was unaware about the pregnancy of the victim, even when she was taken to the Medical College Hospital. He alleged that Mujeeb, son of PW5 was responsible for the pregnancy of PW1 and in order to save him, the appellant was implicated by PW1 under the persuasion of her mother, PW5. No evidence except Ext.D1, a contradiction in the former statement of PW1, was let in. 4. The trial court, after analysing the evidence in detail, concluded that PW1 was a reliable witness and her evidence coupled with the oral testimonies of PW4, the Doctor and PW5, the mother, proved the guilt of the appellant beyond doubt. The said finding and the reasons thereof are assailed in this appeal filed under Section 374(2) of the Code. 5. Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Senior Public Prosecutor. 6. PW1 is the victim. She was aged 13 years at the time of occurrence. The appellant is her father and PW5 is her mother. PW1 was residing along with her siblings, the appellant and her mother (PW5). Her brother, Mujeed was born to PW5 in her first marriage. In her second wedlock of PW5 with the appellant, PW1 and her younger sister were born. All of them were residing together at their house at Ponmala. 7. The first incident of rape occurred at the house of the appellant's elder brother at Edapatta. Subsequently, on a few occasions she was subjected to sexual abuse by the appellant at their house at Ponmala. She has narrated about such incidents. The appellant took PW1 and her younger sister to the house of his elder brother, stating that his younger brother was coming home from abroad. On that day his elder brother was absent and his sister-in-law alone was there. 8. PW1 deposed that she and her sister slept in a room. After her sister went asleep, the appellant subjected her to sexual intercourse despite her residence. She deposed further that on subsequent occasions while they were at their house at Ponmala, she was subjected to sexual intercourse by the appellant on a few occasions during Ramadan season. 9. PW1 got impregnated. On noticing her swollen abdomen, PW5 along with the appellant took PW1 to a Doctor at Ponmala who noticed her to be pregnant, and instructed to take her to the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. After examination, PW4, a professor in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Medical College, confirmed pregnancy. Age of the fetus was found to be above six months. Owing to her tender age, PW1 was retained in that hospital and a child was delivered by her. 10. PW5 deposed that she along with the appellant took PW1 on 09.03.2009 to the Doctor on noticing her abdominal distension. After confirmation of the pregnancy by the Doctor, PW1 told that the appellant was responsible. It is her further version that the appellant suggested to take PW1 to some hospitals and to do the necessary. Accordingly, PW1 was taken to the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. 11. PW4 was the Professor in Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Government Medical College, Kozhikode. She deposed that on 11.03.2009 she examined PW1 and at that time PW1 was carrying a fetus of 26 weeks of age. She was told by PW1 that her father was responsible for the pregnancy. PW4 proceeded to depose that being a case of teenage pregnancy, PW1 was retained in the hospital, and she gave birth to a child on 30.05.2009. She was discharged from the hospital on 03.06.2009. Ext.P5 is the certificate issued by PW4. 12. The F.I.statement, Ext.P1 was recorded from PW1 on 13.03.2009. Based on Ext.P1, the crime was registered. Ext.P6 is the FIR. PW7, Circle inspector of Police has conducted the investigation and laid the charge. A potency test of the appellant was conducted by PW3 and the certificate in that regard is Ext.P3. In the opinion of PW3, there was nothing to suggest that the appellant was incapable of doing sexual acts. 13. The proof or not of the charge against the appellant depends on the reliability of PW1. It was on 09.03.2009 she was examined by the Doctor and confirmed the pregnancy. On 11.03.2009 she was examined by PW4 at the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. On 13.03.2009 she gave Ext.P1 statement. Going by the oral evidence, immediately on revealing the pregnancy, PW1 told PW5 that the appellant was responsible. PW1 claimed to have stated that fact to the Doctor at Orchid Hospital, Malappuram, where she was scanned and examined. That Doctor was not examined. But PW4, who examined PW1 on 11.03.2009 stated in court that PW1 revealed the appellant as the person responsible and that version repeated in Ext.P1 that was given on 13.03.2009. Thus, from the very beginning, the version of PW1 regarding the person responsible for her pregnancy has been consistent. 14. The learned counsel would submit that PW1 accused the appellant in order to save Mujeeb, the son of PW5 in her first marriage. Various circumstances have been pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant and it is submitted that since the only evidence available to implicate the appellant with the crime is the oral testimony of PW1, any doubt appeared in her evidence has to go in favour of the appellant. It is submitted, only if PW1 can be termed as a witness of sterling quality, there can be conviction. In that regard, the learned counsel placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Christopher v. State of Kerala [2024 KHC 7137] and a line of decisions referred to therein. 15. Inconsistencies in the evidence of PW1 highlighted by the learned counsel for the appellant are essentially a few improbabilities. Regarding the first incident, the narration by PW1 was that while sleeping along with her younger sister it occurred. That and the way in which she was allegedly abused are said to be improbable. The incidents allegedly occurred at their house at Ponmala were in the wee hours during Ramzan days. All were sleeping together. PW5 used to go to the kitchen at or around 4.00 p.m. It was at that time PW1 was sexually misused. PW1 admitted her interaction with Mujeeb which was to the dislike of the appellant. He even warned PW5 against it. Although it was suggested that PW1 lied along with Mujeeb and she was therefore scolded by the appellant, it was denied by her. 16. It appears from the evidence that the appellant did not like PW1 interacting with Mujeeb closely. Along with that the version of PW5 to the effect that it was Mujeeb and not the appellant who was looking after the house hold affairs is highlighted. Those matters were relied in support of the defence plea that in order to save Mujeeb, the appellant was falsely implicated. Yet another aspect pointed out is that no scientific test like DNA examination was conducted and it was with an oblique motive of screening Mujeeb from the prosecution. 17. The aforementioned contentions are strongly refuted by the learned Public Prosecutor. It is submitted that the evidence of PW1 is blemish free. She being the daughter, it cannot be expected that she falsely implicate the appellant. Except suggestions by the appellant, there is no evidence or circumstance to even remotely probabilise the defence plea. Accordingly, the learned Senior Public Prosecutor would submit that the findings of the trial court are quite convincing and devoid of any infirmity. 18. Decisions of the Apex Court which dealt with the question concerning reliability of the victim of a sexual offence have been encapsulated by a Division Bench of this Court in the judgment in Christopher (supra). The relevant part of that judgment is extracted below: \n \"26. In Nirmal Premkumar and another v. State, represented  by Inspector of Police  [(2024) SCC OnLine SC 260], the Apex Court while elucidating the principles that are to be borne in mind while appreciating oral testimony, it was observed as under in paragraph No. 11 of the judgment: \n \"11. Law is well settled that generally speaking, oral testimony may be classified into three categories, viz. : (i) wholly reliable; (ii) wholly unreliable; (iii) neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable. The first two category of cases may not pose serious difficulty for the Court in arriving at its conclusion(s). However, in the third category of cases, the Court has to be circumspect and look for corroboration of any material particulars by reliable testimony, direct or circumstantial, as a requirement of the rule of prudence.\" 27. In State of H.P. v. Raghubir Singh [(1993) 2 SCC 622] , the Apex Court held that there is no legal compulsion to look for any other evidence to corroborate the evidence of the prosecutrix before recording an order of conviction. Evidence has to be weighed and not counted. Conviction can be recorded on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix if her evidence inspires confidence and there is absence of circumstances which militate against her veracity. 28. In Rai Sandeep v. State (NCT of Delhi) [(2012) 8 SCC 21], under what circumstances can a witness be categorized as a sterling witness, the Apex Court had held as under: \n \"22. In our considered opinion, the 'sterling witness' should be of a very high quality and calibre whose version should, therefore, be unassailable. The court considering the version of such witness should be in a position to accept it for its face value without any hesitation. To test the quality of such a witness, the status of the witness would be immaterial and what would be relevant is the truthfulness of the statement made by such a witness. What would be more relevant would be the consistency of the statement right from the starting point till the end, namely, at the time when the witness makes the initial statement and ultimately before the court. It should be natural and consistent with the case of the prosecution qua the accused. There should not be any prevarication in the version of such a witness. The witness should be in a position to withstand the cross-examination of any length and howsoever strenuous it may be and under no circumstance should give room for any doubt as to the factum of the occurrence, the persons involved, as well as the sequence of it. Such a version should have co-relation with each and every one of other supporting material such as the recoveries made, the weapons used, the manner of offence committed, the scientific evidence and the expert opinion. The said version should consistently match with the version of every other witness. It can even be stated that it should be akin to the test applied in the case of circumstantial evidence where there should not be any missing link in the chain of circumstances to hold the accused guilty of the offence alleged against him. Only if the version of such a witness qualifies the above test as well as all other such similar tests to be applied, can it be held that such a witness can be called as a 'sterling witness' whose version can be accepted by the court without any corroboration and based on which the guilty can be punished. To be more precise, the version of the said witness on the core spectrum of the crime should remain intact while all other attendant materials, namely, oral, documentary and material objects should match the said version in material particulars in order to enable the court trying the offence to rely on the core version to sieve the other supporting materials for holding the offender guilty of the charge alleged. 29. In State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain [(1990) 1 SCC 550], the Apex Court held that a woman, who is the victim of sexual assault, is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person's lust and, therefore, her evidence need not be tested with the same amount of suspicion as that of an accomplice. The Court observed as under in paragraph No.16: \n \"16. A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on a par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to Illustration (b) to Section 114 which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence.\" 30. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh[(1996) 2 SCC 384], the Apex Court held that in cases involving sexual harassment, molestation etc., the court is duty-bound to deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. Minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of a prosecutrix should not be a ground for throwing out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. Evidence of the victim of sexual assault is enough for conviction and it does not require any corroboration unless there are compelling reasons for seeking corroboration. The court may look for some assurances of her statement to satisfy judicial conscience. The statement of the prosecutrix is more reliable than that of an injured witness as she is not an accomplice. The Court further held that the delay in filing FIR for sexual offence may not be even properly explained, but if found natural, the accused cannot be given any benefit thereof. The Court went on to observe as under in paragraph Nos. 8 & 21: \n \"8. .................... The court overlooked the situation in which a poor helpless minor girl had found herself in the company of three desperate young men who were threatening her and preventing her from raising any alarm. Again, if the investigating officer did not conduct the investigation properly or was negligent in not being able to trace out the driver or the car, how can that become a ground to discredit the testimony of the prosecutrix? The prosecutrix had no control over the investigating agency and the negligence of an investigating officer could not affect the credibility of the statement of the prosecutrix. ........................... The courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self-respecting woman would come forward in a court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. ......................................... Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. ................................ Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx 21. ............................ The courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If for some reason the court finds it difficult to place implicit reliance on her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the trial court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations. 32. In State of Orissa v. Thakara Besra [(2002) 9 SCC 86], the Apex Court held that rape is not mere physical assault, rather it often destroys the whole personality of the victim. The rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female and, therefore, the testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case, and in such cases, non-examination even of other witnesses may not be a serious infirmity in the prosecution case, particularly where the witnesses had not seen the commission of the offence. 33. In Krishan Kumar Malik (supra), the Apex Court emphasized the duty of the court to differentiate between genuine cases from frivolous and concocted ones. It was held that the role of courts in such cases is to see whether the evidence available before the court is enough and cogent to prove the guilt of the accused. It was held as follows in paragraphs Nos. 31 and 32 of the judgment: 31. No doubt, it is true that to hold an accused guilty for commission of an offence of rape, the solitary evidence of the prosecutrix is sufficient provided the same inspires confidence and appears to be absolutely trustworthy, unblemished and should be of sterling quality. But, in the case in hand, the evidence of the prosecutrix, showing several lacunae, which have already been projected hereinabove, would go to show that her evidence does not fall in that category and cannot be relied upon to hold the appellant guilty of the said offences. 32. Indeed there are several significant variations in material facts in her Section 164 statement, Section 161 statement (CrPC), FIR and deposition in court. Thus, it was necessary to get her evidence corroborated independently, which they could have done either by examination of Ritu, her sister or Bimla Devi, who were present in the house at the time of her alleged abduction. The record shows that Bimla Devi though cited as a witness was not examined and later given up by the public prosecutor on the ground that she has been won over by the appellant. 33. After evaluating all the past precedents, the Apex Court in Nirmal Premkumar (supra) held that in cases where witnesses are neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable, the Court should strive to find out the true genesis of the incident. The Court can rely on the victim as a 'sterling witness' without further corroboration, but the quality and credibility must be exceptionally high. The statement of the prosecutrix ought to be consistent from the beginning to the end (minor inconsistencies excepted) from the initial statement to the oral testimony, without creating any doubt qua the prosecution's case. While a victim's testimony is usually enough for sexual offence cases, an unreliable or insufficient account from the prosecutrix, marked by identified flaws and gaps, could make it difficult for a conviction to be recorded.\n\n.",

Mr. Naval Kishore Gupta - learned counsel for appellant. Mr. Rajeev Upadhyay - Public Prosecutor for respondent - State. Heard on I.A. No.17030/2023, which is second application under Section 389 (1) of Cr.P.C. for suspension of sentence and grant of bail filed on behalf of appellant- Deepak Rajak. Appellant stood convicted under Section 363 of IPC r/w 3(2)(v-a) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (in short, Act), Section 366 of IPC r/w 3(2)(v) of the Act and 376(3) r/w 3(2)(v) of the Act and sentenced to undergo two years RI with fine of Rs.1,000/-, imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.1,000/- and imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.2,000/- with default stipulation respectively vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 24.11.2022 passed by Special Judge (POCSO Act 2012), Shivpuri (M.P.) in S.C. No.90/2021. Appellant so far has undergone incarceration of three years and two months. A s per prosecution story, an FIR was lodged on 29.02.2020 by the prosecutrix accompanied by her parents and brother to the effect that on 26.01.2020 while her father was ill and her mother & sister had gone to the field and she was alone at the home, the present appellant, who was her neighbour, came to her house. He made false promise of marriage and thereafter manipulated her and she was subjected to sexual abuse. Besides, the appellant had taken her to Jhansi and went to take the ticket while leaving her at Jhansi platform. Thereafter, the prosecutrix came back home by traveling in the bus. On such allegations, the investigation was started. Upon completion of investigation, challan was filed and the case was committed to the Sessions Court for Trial. The Sessions Court after proper evaluation of evidence placed on record convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above. Learned counsel for the appellant, while taking exception to the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence submits that the appellant is innocent and has been falsely implicated. It is a case of consent. The prosecutrix on her own volition had gone with the appellant. There is delay of one month in lodging of FIR. There is no medical evidence which supports the case of prosecution. As per Ex.D-5, medical ossification report, her age is 16-18 years. The prosecutrix's father PW-15 himself stated that date-of-birth of the prosecutrix was mentioned in the school record on hypothetical basis, for which they have no record. In the aforesaid circumstances, the impugned judgment is based on surmises and conjectures and suffers from vice of perversity. The appellant has already suffered incarceration of 3 years and 2 months. There is no likelihood of the early disposal of the appeal in the near future. Under such circumstances, learned counsel for the appellant prays that benefit of suspension of sentence may be extended to present appellant. Per contra, learned counsel for the State while supporting the impugned judgment opposes the suspension application and prays for its rejection with submission that the date-of-birth of the prosecutrix was 10.06.2007 and the incident took place on 26.01.2020 and thus, at that time she was 14 years of age, therefore, her consent is irrelevant.

The prosecution allegation is that on 10.6.2018, the petitioner had sexually assaulted a minor girl child aged only 9 years and thereby committed the aforesaid offences. 4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner is a pretty old man aged 60 years. He has been falsely implicated in the case. He apprehends arrest and torture by the Police and hence this petition. 5.Learned Public Prosecutor has vehemently opposed this application and submitted that the investigation of the case is only in the initial stage. 6.

Briefly, the case has been registered on the allegations that the child victim aged about 13 years was sexually abused. The petitioner along with four other persons had sexually abused and committed oral sex. Love-co-accused has also sexually abused the child in the room of Rinku. The petitioner had taken the child to Sergarh where he was kept in custody.

The petitioner along with four other persons are facing trial. All the accused except the petitioner and Rahul Kumar have been released on bail. Furthermore, Rahul Kumar, co-accused has also been granted bail by this Court. The petitioner is in custody since 17.10.2018 and is not involved in any other case. The statement of the victim as well as his parents have also been recorded. The trial of the case is going at fairly good pace and has opposed the bail application on the score that the co-accused have sexually abused the child aged about 13 years and they were sharing common interest with the petitioner. It is significant to note that the co-accused have been granted bail and the victim and parents have also been examined during the course of trial.

    "Passage": "Jibitha vs Diyol on 28 January, 2020. The petitioner is the respondent in I.A.No.1162/2019 in GOP No.467/2019, on the file of Family Court, Trissur. The respondent in this original petition had filed the above application seeking interim custody of his minor son Dhanvin and permission to interact with his younger son Sidharth during holidays and vacation periods. In the application filed before the Family Court, the respondent had, inter alia, pleaded that, after the birth of the younger child, the petitioner refused to return to the matrimonial home. Subsequently, there was a mediation, and a rapprochement was effected. Immediately after conceiving the younger child, the petitioner went to her parental home and thereafter, has refused to resume co-habitation. The respondent is anxious to look after the welfare of the children, but the petitioner is not permitting the same. Therefore, interim custody of the older child may be given to him, and he be permitted to interact with the younger child. The application was opposed by the petitioner, who filed a written objection, inter alia, contending that the respondent is an alcoholic. Subsequent to the separation between them, there was a settlement before the Police, and the older child was agreed to be given on every Friday. However, the respondent's close friend Jayesh abused the child, and on a complaint by the petitioner, Crime No.93/2019 was registered by the Guruvayoor Police Station, for offences punishable under POCSO Act and under Section 377 of IPC against Jayesh. Hence custody of the child shall not be given to the petitioner. The petitioner hence prays that the application may be dismissed. The Family Court after considering the application and the counter filed, and also after interacting with the child, who did not raise any complaint against the father, held that by merely raising allegations of sexual assault against the respondent's friend, the respondent cannot be restricted from having interim custody and visitation rights of his children. Accordingly, the Family Court allowed I.A.No.1162/2019 by granting interim custody of the older child to the respondent from 11 a.m. of every 2nd Saturday till 3 p.m. on the following Sunday, with visitation right from 11 am to 1 pm on every 4th Sunday. Likewise, the respondent was permitted to interact with the younger child from 10 am to 11 am on every 2nd Saturday and from 11 am to 1 pm on every 4th Sunday. It is challenging the above order this original petition is filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, contending that the impugned order passed by the Family Court is erroneous and improper and is liable to be set aside. This Court in Suhara and Others v. Muhammed Jaleel [2019 (2) KLT 960] has held that, even if one of the parents is accused of an allegation in a crime under the POCSO Act, is no assurance to a Family court that the allegation is true. The Court has to consider the paramount welfare and interest of the child while granting custody of the child to such parent, and further that the registration of the crime is not a bar in granting the parent access and visitation right of the child. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Anjali Kapoor vs. Rajiv Baijal [(2009) 7 SCC 322] has categorically declared the law that in a battle for custody of the child, Court should see what would best serve the welfare and interest of the child, which is the soul and predominant criteria and not the legal rights of the warring parents. In a most recent decision by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Yashita Sahu vs State of Rajasthan and others [2020 SCC OnLine (SC) 50] rendered on 20.1.2020, has declared as follows: 'The child is the victim in custody battles. In this fight of egos and increasing acrimonious battles and litigations between two spouses, our experience shows that more often than not, the parents who otherwise love their child, present a picture as if the other spouse is a villain and he or she alone is entitled to the custody of the child. The court must therefore be very vary of what is said by each of the spouses. A child, especially a child of tender years requires the love, affection, company, protection of both parents. This is not only the requirement of the child but is his/her basic human right. Just because the parents are at war with each other, does not mean that the child should be denied the care, affection, love or protection of any one of the two parents. A child is not an inanimate object which can be tossed from one parent to the other. Every separation, every re-union may have a traumatic and psychosomatic impact on the child. Therefore, it is to be ensured that the court weighs each and every circumstance very carefully before deciding how and in what manner the custody of the child should be shared between both the parents. Even if the custody is given to one parent the other parent must have sufficient visitation rights to ensure that the child keeps in touch with the other parent and does not lose social, physical and psychological contact with any one of the two parents. It is only in extreme circumstances that one parent should be denied contact with the child. Reasons must be assigned if one parent is to be denied any visitation rights or contact with the child. Courts dealing with the custody matters must while deciding issues of custody clearly define the nature, manner and specifics of the visitation rights.' Undisputedly, in the present case the allegation is that, the respondent's friend and neighbour attempted to abuse the child and he is accused in POCSO case, therefore, the child shall not be given to the respondent. In view of the categoric declaration of law in the authoritative precedents cited supra, we are unable to accept the contentions that the handing over of the custody of the older child to the respondent would be detrimental to the paramount welfare and best interest of the older child, and that the respondent should be denied visitation rights of the younger child. The learned Judge of the Family Court had interacted with the older child and found that he has no complaint to go with his father and that there is no harm if the older child is being sent with the father on every 2nd Saturday till the following Sunday. Similarly, the father has been given visitation right to see the younger child also on every 2nd Saturday and 4th Sunday. The granting of interim custody and visitation rights would only benefit their paramount welfare and best interest. It is the welfare of the children that is to be looked into and not the rights and defences of the quarrelling parents. We do not find any ground warranting interference with the impugned order invoking the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The original petition is without merit. Accordingly, the Original Petition is dismissed.",
    "Question": "In light of the situation involving Jibitha and Diyol regarding custody and visitation rights, what procedural steps can the petitioner follow to further contest the ruling of the Family Court, and how might these steps relate to ensuring the safety and welfare of the children involved?",
    "A": "The petitioner can file for a restraining order against the respondent without further evidence.",
    "B": "The petitioner can initiate an appeal process based on alleged threats and file for an evaluation of the children's circumstances.",
    "C": "The petitioner must accept the ruling as it is without further legal recourse available.",
    "D": "The petitioner can handle the situation informally by discussing it with the respondent.",
    "Correct Answer": "The petitioner can initiate an appeal process based on alleged threats and file for an evaluation of the children's circumstances.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage indicates that the petitioner has filed an original petition challenging the Family Court's decision, suggesting a legal path to appeal based on concerns for the children's welfare, thus providing the opportunity to ensure their safety."

    "Passage": "Karnataka High Court Ashok S/O Punnu Rathod vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 November, 2016. IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA KALABURAGI BENCH DATED THIS THE 18TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2016 BEFORE THE HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE S.N.SATYANARAYANA CRIMINAL APPEAL No. 200125/2016 Between: Ashok S/o Punnu Rathod Age: 27 years, Occ: Coolie R/o Ingalgi, L.T.No. 2, Tq. Indi, Dist. Vijayapur ... Appellant (By Smt Ratna N. Shivayogimath and Sri Sharanabasappa K. Babshetty, Advocates) And: The State of Karnataka Through the CPI Indi Circle Dist Vijayapur Represented by SPP High Court of Karnataka at Kalaburagi Bench ... Respondent (By Sri Sheshadri Jaishankar, HCGP) This Criminal Appeal is filed under Section 374(2) of the Cr.P.C., praying to set aside the judgment and sentence dated 19.10.2015 and 21.10.2015 passed by the special judge and II Addl. Sessions Judge, Vijayapur, at Vijayapur in Special Case (POSCO) No. 21/2014, and acquit the appellant in the said case. This appeal is coming on for admission this day, the Court delivered the following: JUDGMENT The accused in Special Case (POCSO) No.21/2014 on the file of II Addl. Sessions Judge, Vijaypur has come up in this appeal challenging the order of conviction and sentence. In the proceedings before Session's Court, charge sheet was filed against the appellant herein for the offence punishable U/Sec.3(a) (b), 4, 5(m) and 6 of Protection of the Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and U/Sec.376(f) of Indian Penal Code. The aforesaid charge sheet is filed based on a complaint wherein it is stated that on 6.1.2014 appellant herein is said to have sexually abused victim girl CW-4 namely Sujata who is aged about 8 years and resident of Ingalagi Tanda. On the ill-fated day when she had gone to attend nature call at about 6.15 p.m., in the evening, by luring the said child with chocolates and biscuits accused forcibly took her into the field of one Kulkarni wherein Jawar crop was standing. The accused is said to have made the child to lay on the ground, removed her under garment and slept on her. It is also accused that he inserted his finger into her vagina, pressed in it and bit her lips and subsequently committed rape on her. A complaint was filed in this behalf, wherein, investigation was conducted and thereafter charge sheet was filed and the matter was committed to Sessions wherein cognizance for the offence was taken on 18.7.2014. After the charges are framed, same was read over to him. Since he pleaded not guilty, matter was taken up for trial. On behalf of prosecution, in all 17 witnesses are examined and 26 documents are marked. The material objects produced at MOs-1 to 5 are also taken into consideration. In the Court below, P.Ws.6 and 8 are the parent of victim girl. It is seen that P.Ws.9, 10, 11 and 12 have turned hostile and did not support the prosecution. Even P.Ws.1 and 7 panch witnesses to the spot panchanama Ex.P-1 and seizure panchanama Ex.P-2 except admitting their signature on said panchanamas, they have not supported the case. Therefore, in the Court below, they were treated as hostile witnesses and they were subjected to cross examination by prosecution. It is seen, in this proceedings that even the complainant - father of victim himself has turned hostile. However, after he was subjected to cross examination, the learned Session's Judge was able to elicit from him and as well as other witnesses that the injuries suffered by the child P.W.2 Sujata to her private part is not due to fall in the field and it is due to heinous act committed by the accused. On going through the judgment impugned, it is clearly seen that the prosecution and learned Sessions Judge has taken enormous strain to see that the truth is elicited from the victim as well as her family members to reconstruct the whole incident to bring the guilt of accused to the books, when all of them conspired together to bury the truth either for fear of shame in the society or fearing retaliatory action from the accused. On giving careful consideration to the entire judgment of the Court below, one thing is clear that the manner in which the entire prosecution has sought to be suppressed not only by the witnesses but also by the family members considering the future of the victim girl who is aged about 8 years, this Court is sympathetic to the family of the victim who have not supported the prosecution, who have given false evidence against the interest of their own child who is victim of sexual abuse. In any event, with proper appreciation of material on record, the Session's Court has been able to bring the accused to books and convict him for the offences punishable under the aforesaid provisions. On careful consideration of the judgement impugned as well as the material available in the form of evidence of the witnesses more particularly their cross examination, it is clearly seen that no grounds are made out by the accused in Spl.Case (POCSO) No.21/2014 to convert the finding of Session's Court in the aforesaid judgment to convert the conviction to an acquittal and also to disturb the sentence imposed on him. In fact this Court feels that considering the nature of offences, the punishment imposed is liberal one. In any event, since there is no appeal on behalf of the prosecution challenging the sentence disturbing the sentence does not arise. Accordingly, this appeal filed by the accused is hereby dismissed.",

    "Passage": "'S '(Ccl) vs State/ Govt Of Nct ... on 17 August, 2017\n\nIN THE COURT OF SHRI PREM KUMAR BARTHWAL, ASJ­01, SPECIAL COURT (POCSO), SOUTHEAST DISTRICT, SAKET COURTS, NEW DELHI\n\nCase ID No. DLSE01­001009­2017 Crl. Appeal No. 67/17 FIR No. 351/16 Police Station : Lajpat Nagar Under Section : 302/34 IPC 'S '(CCL), S/o Shri 'G' (Appellant being minor is represented through natural guardian/father, Sh. 'G') ........Appellant.\nVersus\nState/ Govt of NCT .......Non­appellant/respondent\nO R D E R 1. Vide this order I shall decide the appeal filed on behalf of the appellant/CCL 'S' through his father against the order dated 13.01.2017 passed by the Ld. Juvenile Justice Board­II Delhi wherein the Ld. JJB has directed that medical opinion with regard to the age of the CCL/appellant be obtained by a duly constituted medical board at Safdarjung Hospital. 2. The appellant/CCL was apprehended by the police during the investigation of FIR No. 351/16, PS Lajpat Nagar which was initially registered U/s 307/34 IPC but subsequently due to death of the victim, Section 302 IPC was also added in the said case. 3. The appellant/CCL claimed juvenility and consequently age determination inquiry was conducted by the Ld. JJB­II. During the course of said inquiry it has come on record that after his apprehension the appellant/CCL had furnished his school documents in the nature of Scholar's register and transfer certificate Form purportedly issued from Chaudhary Beerpal Singh Inter College, Barah Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh. However the said document was found to be forged upon verification and subsequently yet another school record in the nature of school leaving certificate purportedly issued by Principal, Dhani Ram Sharma Public School, Makanpur Khadar, Post Dankaur District, Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh was filed alongwith bail application of appellant/CCL. In the age determination inquiry, the Ld. Board has examined CW­1, Principal of the said school and CW­2, Shri Harjit Panwar, Head Clerk, Transport Authority, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi. The Ld. JJB also examined the appellant/CCL under section 165 Evidence Act wherein the CCL claimed that he had taken admission in Chaudhary Beerpal Singh Inter College, Barah Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh but he did not attend any classes. He was also examined in order to ascertain the documents on the basis of which he had set up his date of birth of 08.09.1992 before the Transport Authority at Delhi for procuring his driving licence but the Ld. Counsel for the CCL has contended that the said driving licence was procured through a tout/middle man. The Juvenile Justice Board placed reliance on the judgments titled, 'Om Prakash Vs. State of Rajasthan & Anr.','Parag Bhati Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.' and other judgment titled 'Mukarrab Vs. State of UP' to hold that the plea of minority set up by the CCL is not free from ambiguity and doubts. The JJB directed for obtaining the medical opinion based on scientific investigations as regards age of CCL. 4. The Ld. counsel for appellant has vehemently argued that once the Juvenile Justice Board had examined CW­1, Principal of Dhani Ram Sharma Public School, Uttar Pradesh then there was no occasion for the JJB to order for constitution of medical board for seeking medical opinion in respect of the age of the appellant. 5. The Hon'ble Apex Court in 'Om Prakash vs. State of Rajasthan (Supra)' has decided about the approach to be adopted in age enquiry in grave and heinous offences and held that if there is a clear and unambiguous case in favour of the juvenile accused that he was a minor below the age of 18 years on the date of the incident, he would be entitled for this special protection under the Juvenile Justice Act. But when an accused commits a grave and heinous offence and attempts to take statutory shelter under the guise of being a minor, a casual or cavalier approach, cannot be permitted as the courts are enjoined upon to perform their duties with the object of protecting the confidence of common man in the institution entrusted with the administration of justice. 6. Thus in a circumstance where the Ld JJB cannot arrive at a conclusive finding regarding the age of the accused, the opinion of the medical experts based on x­ray and ossification test can be obtained. 7. The benefit of the principle of benevolent legislation attached to Juvenile Justice Act would thus apply to only such cases wherein the accused is held to be a juvenile based on cogent evidence regarding his minority as the benefit of the possibilities of two views regarding the age of the alleged accused involved in grave and serious offence cannot be allowed merely upon doubtful school admission record. 8. In view of the above discussions, the impugned order of the Ld. JJB for obtaining the medical opinion can not be faulted by appellant/CCL who gives forged and fabricated school documents regarding his age initially and also uses documents showing his majority for obtaining Driving Licence from Transport authority/Govt Dept but hides the said documents when involved in case of heinous nature.",
    "Question": "What implications arise from the findings and decisions of the JJB in the appeal of appellant/CCL 'S' concerning the age determination when the evidence presented was deemed inadequate? Discuss the role of scientific evidence in such cases.",
    "A": "The JJB must only use unverified documents presented by the appellant without gathering further evidence.",
    "B": "Judicial findings mandate a comprehensive medical examination when documentary evidence raises doubts regarding age.",
    "C": "The JJB can administer a verdict immediately without needing any evidence since the appellant claimed minority.",
    "D": "The JJB should solely rely on the appellant's account of his age without questioning its authenticity.",
    "Correct Answer": "Judicial findings mandate a comprehensive medical examination when documentary evidence raises doubts regarding age.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage indicates that due to the forged nature of school documents and doubts stemming from the appellant's age claims, the Juvenile Justice Board decided to seek medical opinion through scientific methods, reinforcing that adequate age determination hinges on reliable evidence rather than solely on the documents provided by the appellant."

Saurav'.\n\n2.         The present petition has been filed by the\npetitioners to quash the FIR, in question. In the present\ncase, petitioner No.1 is the accused, whereas, petitioner\nNo.2 is the child victim.\n\n3.          The main ground, upon which, the quashing of\nFIR has been sought, is that during the pendency of the\ncase, petitioners have solemnized the marriage on\n21.02.2025. In this regard, they have relied upon the\nmarriage certificate.\n\n4.          Not only this, petitioners have also pleaded that\nthey have been blessed with two children.\n\n5.         Perusal of record shows that FIR, in question,\nhas been lodged on the statement of respondent No.2, who,\nat the relevant time, was working as Legal-cum-Probation\nOfficer, District Child Protection Unit, District Solan, H.P.\n\n6.         In this background, when, learned counsel,\nappearing for the petitioners, has been confronted with the\nmaintainability of the present petition, then, learned\ncounsel for the petitioners could not satisfy the judicial\nconscience of this Court.\n\n7.          The FIR, in question, has been registered,\nunder the special statute i.e. POCSO Act. The Legislature,\nin its wisdom, has enacted the special statute, i.e. POCSO\nAct, by keeping in view the rising number of cases, being\ncommitted against the children. Once, it has been held\nthat the offences are against the State, then, it is the duty\nof the State to prosecute the offender, before the competent\nCourt of law.\n\n8.         As observed earlier, the Legislature, in its\nwisdom, has enacted the POCSO Act, with an object to\nreduce the child abuse and protection of the children from\nsexual offences. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Criminal\nAppeal No.3403 of 2023, titled as 'Ramji Lal Bairwa &\nAnr. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.', Neutral Citation\nNo.2024       (INSC)     846, has elaborately discussed the\nprovisions of POCSO Act and has held that the quashing of\nthe proceedings, under Section 528 of the BNSS, in POCSO\ncases, on the basis of the settlement, is against the\nlegislative intent, behind the enactment. Relevant\nparagraphs 10 to 12 and 31 of the said judgment are\nreproduced, as under:-\n\n              \"10. Before dealing with the contentions on\n              behalf of the respondents and also the\n              submissions of the learned amicus curiae and\n              the counsel for the intervenor, we think it only\n              appropriate to refer to certain relevant aspects of\n              the POCSO Act. As introduction to the POCSO\n              Act, what actually actuated the Parliament to\n              enact 'POCSO Act' has been stated thus:-\n                \"Sexual offences against children are not\n                adequately addressed by the existing laws. A\n                large number of such offences are neither\n                specifically provided with nor are they\n                adequately penalised. Such offences against\n                children need to be defined explicitly and\n                countered through adequate penalties as an\n                effective deterrence. This Act provides for\n                protection of children from offences of sexual\n                assault, sexual harassment and pornography\n                with due regard for safeguarding the interest\n                and well-being of children.\"\n              11. Contextually, it is worthy to refer to the\n              statement of objects and reasons for the\n              enactment of the POCSO Act.       It reads as\n              follows: -\n              5                               2025:HHC:5611\n\n\"STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\nArticle 15 of the Constitution, inter alia,\nconfers upon the State powers to make special\nprovision for children. Further, article 39, inter\nalia, provides that the State shall in particular\ndirect its policy towards securing that the\ntender age of children are not abused and\ntheir childhood and youth are protected\nagainst exploitation and they are given\nfacilities to develop in a healthy manner and\nin conditions of freedom and dignity.\n2. The United Nations Convention on the\nRights of Children, ratified by India on 11th\nDecember, 1992, requires the State Parties to\nundertake all appropriate national, bilateral\nand multilateral measures to prevent (a) the\ninducement or coercion of a child to engage in\nany unlawful sexual activity; (b) the\nexploitative use of children in prostitution or\nother unlawful sexual practices; and (c) the\nexploitative use of children in pornographic\nperformances and materials.\n3. The data collected by the National Crime\nRecords Bureau shows that there has been\nincrease in cases of sexual offences against\nchildren. This is corroborated by the 'Study on\nChild Abuse: India 2007' conducted by the\nMinistry of Women and Child Development.\nMoreover, sexual offences against children are\nnot adequately addressed by the existing\nlaws. A large number of such offences are\nneither specifically provided for nor are they\nadequately penalised. The interests of the\nchild, both as a victim as well as a witness,\nneed to be protected. It is felt that offences\nagainst children need to be defined explicitly\nand     countered     through    commensurate\npenalties as an effective deterrence.\n4. It is, therefore, proposed to enact a self\ncontained comprehensive legislation inter alia\nto provide for protection of children from the\noffences of sexual assault, sexual harassment\nand pornography with due regard for\nsafeguarding the interest and well being of the\n                 6                                 2025:HHC:5611\n\nchild at every stage of the judicial process,\nincorporating child-friendly procedures for\nreporting, recording of evidence, investigation\nand trial of offences and provision for\nestablishment of Special Courts for speedy\ntrial of such offences.\n5. The Bill would contribute to enforcement of\nthe right of all children to safety, security and\nprotection from sexual abuse and exploitation.\n6. The notes on clauses explain in detail the\nvarious provisions contained in the Bill.\n7. The Bill seeks to achieve the above\nobjectives.\"\n12. The objects and reasons for the enactment of\nthe POCSO Act, as extracted above, would\nundoubtedly show that quashment of proceeding\ninitiated under POCSO Act abruptly by invoking\nthe power under Section 482, Cr. PC without\npermitting it to mature into a trial, except on\nextremely compelling reasons ex facie malafidely\ninitiated or initiated solely to settle the score etc.,\nwould go against the very intention of the\nlegislature behind the enactment.           As noted\nearlier, it is the inadequacy of the existing laws\nto address certain issues relating sexual\noffences against the children that made the\nlegislature to come up with the aforesaid\nlegislation with a view to protect and respect the\nprivacy and confidentiality of children and to\nensure their physical, emotional, intellectual and\nsocial development.         The POCSO Act also\naddressed the lack of provisions defining various\noffences against the children and also adequate\npenal provisions therefor. A careful scanning of\nthe various provisions under the POCSO Act\nwould reveal that with a view to achieve the\naforesaid objects and purposes various offences\nagainst the children are specifically defined and\nprovisions for adequate penalisation are also\ninserted in the Act.        Obviously, rubbing the\nbreast of a child would constitute an offence of\n'sexual assault' under Section 7 of POCSO Act,\npunishable       with   imprisonment       of   either\ndescription for a term which shall not be less\n                          7                               2025:HHC:5611\n\n          than three years and may extend to five years\n          and also fine.      They would reveal that the\n          commission of such offences against the children\n          should be viewed as heinous and serious.\n          Needless to say, that commission of such\n          offences cannot be taken lightly as offences of\n          private nature and in fact, such offences are\n          bound to be taken as offences against the\n          society.    In the decision in Attorney General\n          for India v. Satish and Anr. at paragraph 38,\n          this Court held thus:-\n             \"The act of touching any sexual part of the\n             body of a child with sexual intent or any other\n             act involving physical contact with sexual\n             intent, could not be trivialised or held\n             insignificant or peripheral so as to exclude\n             such act from the purview of \"sexual assault\"\n under Section 7. As held by this Court in\n             Balram Kumawat v. Union of India, the law\n             would have to be interpreted having regard to\nthe subjectmatter of the offence and to the\n             object of the law it seeks to achieve. The\n             purpose of the law cannot be to allow the\n             offender to sneak out of the meshes of law.\"\n           Xxx          xxx          xxx           xxx\n          31. In view of the very object and purpose of\n          enacting the POCSO Act, we find no reason to\n          disagree with the conclusions in paragraph 12\n          extracted above in the given case. It is more so,\n          when the extracted portion from the complaint\n          that was annexed to the FIR and extracted\n          hereinbefore would reveal that the accused was\n          making pressure on him not to lodge any report.\n          Despite giving such statement in the complaint,\n          within a couple of weeks, the accused managed\n          to compromise the case with the 4th respondent\n          and his wife.\n\n9.        Being guided by the above decision of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court, this Court is of the view that the\npresent petition cannot be accepted, as, the quashing is\nalso against the legislative intent, since, the offence is\nagainst the society and if such type of cases are quashed,\non the basis of the grounds, as taken in the petition, it\nwould encourage the other accused, who had committed\nsuch offence, to adopt the extra constitutional means to\nsettle the matter i.e. influencing the witness by fiduciary\nrelationship, using the money power or threatening the\nvictim/complainant and to settle the matter.\n\n10.               If, the said prayer is allowed, then, it would\namount       to      letting   the   accused    go   without     legal\npunishment, in case, the prosecution is able to prove the\ncase, beyond reasonable doubt, against him.\n\n11.               In view of the discussions, made hereinabove,\nthe present petition is liable to be dismissed and is\naccordingly dismissed.\n\n12.               Pending miscellaneous applications, if any,\nshall also stand disposed of accordingly.\n                                               ( Virender Singh )\n                                                     Judge\nMarch 10, 2025\n(Gaurav Thakur)",

    "Passage": "The further argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant/accused, regarding the discrepancy in the manner of registration of the First Information Report is concerned, it can be seen from the evidence of P.W.1 that she had confronted the mother of the appellant/accused initially and then taken up with the other villagers and finally the complaint was lodged. Considering the nature and background of the parties and the fact that the parents of the victim/child were also not with the child and the child was under the care of his grand-mother, the delay in lodging a complaint is clearly explained and in any event, I am of the view that the same has not caused any prejudice to the appellant/accused especially when he is the sole accused and was a known person and there is no any quarrel over identity.",

CASE NO.207/2016, CONVICTING THE APPELLANT/ACCUSED FOR THE OFFENCE P/U/S 5(m) P/U/S 6 OF POCSO ACT. THIS CRIMINAL APPEAL COMING ON FOR FURTHER HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING: JUDGMENT This is an appeal filed by the accused challenging the Judgment and Order dated 13.12.2018/15.12.2018 passed by the Court of II Additional District and Sessions [Special] Judge, D.K., Mangaluru, in Special Case No.207/2016, convicting and sentencing him for the offence under Section 5(m) punishable under Section 6 of the Protection of the Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 [hereinafter referred to as 'POCSO Act' for short]. The factual matrix of the case as put-forth by the prosecution is as under: A complaint was lodged by Smt. Vidya on 25.07.2016 at about 10.00 p.m., at Konaje Police Station against the accused. It is stated by the first informant that she and her husband are living along with their two children. Her husband was doing centering work. On 23.07.2016, when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, aged about 4 years, her daughter asked her not to pour warm water on her private part as she was having burning sensation. The first informant did not take it seriously. Again on the next day, when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, she told her not to pour warm water on her private part as she was having burning sensation. Again in the afternoon when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, she told her that she was having pain and burning sensation in her private part. When she enquired with her daughter, her daughter informed that on 23.07.2016 when she had gone to the house of the neighbour uncle [accused] for watching T.V., at that time, he lifted her and inserted his finger on her private part and tickled her. Thereafter, at about 2.00 p.m., when the first informant and her daughter were in the front yard, at that time, her daughter showed the accused and told her that he is the one who took her inside the house and inserted the finger in her private part and tickled her. On the basis of the aforesaid complaint lodged by the mother of the victim girl, a case was registered in Crime No.192/2016 of Konaje Police Station against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(a) and 4 of the POCSO Act, 2012, by P.W.11 and he issued Ex.P6-FIR to the jurisdictional Court and thereafter handed over the investigation to P.W.13-Police Inspector. P.W.13 proceeded with the investigation and conducted spot-mahazar as per Ex.P2. The victim girl was sent for medical examination and her medical examination was conducted by P.W.4. The statement of the victim girl was recorded by the Magistrate under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. The articles collected during the course of investigation were sent for forensic examination. After completion of the investigation, charge-sheet was filed against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(a) and 4 of the POCSO Act. Initially, charges were framed against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(b) and 4 of the POCSO Act on 27.04.2017. Additional charges were framed for the offence punishable under Sections 5(m) and 6 of the POCSO Act. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against him and claimed to be tried. Before the trial Court, the prosecution got examined P.Ws.1 to 15 and got marked Exs.P1 to 9 and M.O.1. The accused denied all the incriminating evidence appeared against him while his statement was recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. However, the accused did not choose to lead any evidence on his behalf. The learned Sessions Judge after considering the evidence and material on record, convicted and sentenced the accused for the offence under Section 5(m) punishable under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. Aggrieved by the same, the present appeal has been preferred. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant/accused has vehemently contended that the impugned Judgment and Order passed by the trial Court is opposed to law, facts and probabilities of the case. The trial Court has committed grave error in convicting the accused though the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. He submits that on account of previous enmity, a false complaint was lodged against the accused. There is an inordinate delay in lodging the complaint. The medical evidence does not corroborate with the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. The victim has been tutored by her parents to give false evidence against the accused, which is evident from her cross-examination. He submits that the trial Court has erred in observing that the contradictions in a child's testimony should not be given the same effect as in the testimony of an adult by ignoring the admission given by the victim that she was tutored by her mother to give evidence as deposed by her. He submits that the evidence of the victim girl clearly shows that she was acting under the influence of her parents and therefore, she is a tutored witness. Hence, it is not safe to act upon such evidence particularly when the medical evidence does not corroborate with the evidence of the victim. He therefore submits that the impugned Judgment and Order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court be set aside and the appeal be allowed...",
    "Question": "In a situation involving a minor, what is the significance of medical evidence in a child abuse case under the POCSO Act, and how did the court evaluate the medical findings related to the victim's complaint? Considering the details of the examination and the timing of the reporting, what conclusions can be drawn regarding the admissibility of such medical evidence in supporting a conviction?",
    "A": "Medical evidence was emphasized as conclusive and invaluable in corroborating the victim's statement.",
    "B": "The timing of the medical examination post-incident raised doubts about the conclusions drawn from the findings.",
    "C": "Medical evidence irrelevant because testimonies were strong enough for conviction without it.",
    "D": "The court found the medical examination to be inconsistent with the victim's statements, thus undermining the conviction.",
    "Correct Answer": "B. The timing of the medical examination post-incident raised doubts about the conclusions drawn from the findings.",
    "Reasoning": "According to the passage, the medical examination indicated that the last penetrative attack was approximately 40-45 hours prior to the examination conducted on 26.07.2016, which contradicts the timeline of the alleged incident being on 23.07.2016, thereby raising significant doubts about the medical findings' relevance to support the conviction."

CIS ­ Sessions Case No. 7095/16 FIR No. 391/15 Police Station: Mehrauli In the matter of: State VERSUS Fareem Beg S/o Sh. Mahboob Beg Present Address:­ Coconut Shop situated at CNG Pump, Dera Road, Rajpur Khurd, Delhi Permanent Address:­ V.P.O. Mavai Kajiyan Tehsil Baheri, PS Sher Garh, District Bareilly, U.P. Date of Institution: 11.12.2015 Date of Reserving judgment: Not reserved Date of pronouncement: 30.05.2017 JUDGMENT 1. In the present case, accused Fareem Beg S/o Mahboob Beg has been charged and facing trial for the commission of offences punishable under section 354 of Indian Penal Code (in short 'IPC') and section 10 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (in short 'POCSO Act'), 2012 r/w section 9 of the said Act on the allegations of outraging the modesty of a girl child, namely, V (real name withheld in order to conceal her identity), aged about 8 years and committing aggravated sexual assault upon her. 2. The FIR in question was registered on the complaint of Raju Yadav, the father of the victim girl, who in his complaint has alleged that on 23.08.2015 at 6.00 PM, accused Fareem Beg along with his two associates namely Naim and Sehzad misbehaved with his victim daughter, abused her and gesturing with her and when he objected to the same, he was threatened by accused and his associates. On the said complaint of the father of the victim, the present FIR was registered u/s 506/509 of IPC and section 12 of POCSO Act on 24.08.2015 and the investigation was commenced. 3. During course of investigation, counseling of victim girl was conducted by NGO Mehar Charitable Society through DCW and her statement under section 161 of Cr.P.C. was recorded and site plan of place of occurrence was prepared at the instance of complainant Raju Yadav. Statement of the victim under section 164 of Cr.P.C. was also got recorded. During further investigation, date of birth proof of the victim girl was collected and accused Fareem Beg was arrested on 13.10.2015 and was sent to judicial custody. However, subsequently he was granted bail by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi vide order dated 27.04.2016. Another accused Shezad had joined the investigation but no sufficient evidence against him was found and therefore IO kept his name in column No. 12 of the charge­sheet. The co­accused namely Faim @ Naim who is brother of accused Fareem Beg was evading and he is at large. NBWs against him were taken. On the basis of the statement of the victim girl recorded under section 164 of Cr.P.C, section 506/509 IPC and Section 12 of POCSO Act were added and challan was prepared under sections 354/506/509/34 of IPC and section 8 & 12 of POCSO Act and put up before the court on 11.12.2015 for trial against the accused Fareem Beg. 4. On 29.02.2016, after hearing the Ld. Defence Counsel for the accused Fareem Beg and the Ld. Special Public Prosecution, Charge for the offences punishable under sections 354 of IPC and. 5. The victim and the complainant, who is also father of the victim on whose complaint the present FIR got registered against the accused Fareem Beg, are the star and material witnesses of the prosecution, who could have proved the allegations levelled against the accused. But the prosecution has miserably failed to examine both the witnesses despite availing sufficient opportunities. The prosecution even could not trace out the victim and her father and they could not be served despite best efforts made by the prosecution. The victim girl though in her statement recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C. stated that she was playing at 6'O clock in the evening and at that time Naim, Fareem (accused in the present case) and Shejzaad came there. Naim caught her, Fareem caught and kissed her and put his both the hands in her panty and tried to open her pajama. She shouted loudly then her father came and they all fled away. She further sated that Fareem and Naim came to her father later and threatened him if he would make any complaint in this regard, they would kill her father. But the victim girl did not appear in the witness box to prove all these allegations. In the absence of testimony of victim and her father, no incriminating evidence has come on record against the accused. There is no other eyewitness to the incident. Rest of the witnesses are formal i.e. the counselor who counseled the victim, the principal to prove the age of the victim, DO to prove the registration of FIR, IO and the Ld. MM who recorded the statement of victim u/s 164 Cr.P.C. Hence, it will be a futile exercise to examine rest of the witnesses in this case, as none of them is an eyewitness to the incident. Continuing with this trial any further, will only result in wastage of time and resources, and there will be no impact on the result of this trial. Hence, the prosecution evidence is closed and the SA of the accused is dispensed with. 6. In the overall facts and circumstances of the case, there being no material or incriminating evidence against the accused Fareem Beg, he cannot be said to be guilty of committing the offences as charged against him and he is entitled to be acquitted. Accordingly, Accused Fareem Beg is acquitted of the offences punishable under sections 354 of IPC and section 10 of POCSO Act. 7. However, Fareem Beg is required to furnish bail bond under section 437A of Cr.P.C, which shall remain in force for a period of six months. 8. File be consigned to Record Room, after due compliance of provisions of section 437A of Cr.P.C. by Fareem Beg. Pronounced in the open Court (Balwant Rai Bansal) on 30th of May, 2017. Additional Sessions Judge­01 South District:Saket Courts: New Delhi.",

    "Passage": "Mohd. Aleem, vs The State Oftelangana, on 13 September, 2022. The petitioners claim to be the joint owners of Plot No.64, admeasuring 267 sq. yards situated in Sy.No.844/16 forming part of Annapurna Cooperative Housing Society Limited, Malkajgiri, Ranga Reddy District, having purchased the same under registered sale deed dated 29.09.2010. Subsequently the petitioners constructed Ground plus Three floors (G+3) by obtaining permission from GHMC and the property was assessed with H.No.17-119/A64. The petitioners had been staying in the ground floor of the said building. The petitioners gave first, second and third floor of the building to M/s. Save a Child, a private organization, represented by Sri M. Sunit Kumar, S/o. Christopher, under rental agreement dated 03.07.2014 for a period of 11 months. The lease was extended from time to time. While so, the respondent No.2 addressed a communication dated 22.06.2017, along with a copy of a note approved by the Collector, Medchal-Malkajgiri District, stating that sexual abuse has happened on an inmate of 'Save a Child' orphanage by the founder M. Sunit Kumar and in that connection, the District Collector has given instructions to close and seize the movable and immovable property and bank accounts of the orphanage located in the premises of the petitioners. On the instructions of the District Collector, the respondent No.4 directed the Village Revenue Officer, Malkajgiri, to seize the orphanage, which was being run in the first, second and third floors of the building of the petitioners. Accordingly, three floors were seized on 24.06.2017 under cover of panchanma. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the 'Save a Child' orphanage is the tenant of the petitioners. In the process of taking action against the founder of the orphanage, the property of the petitioners could not have been seized. A request was made by the petitioners vide representation dated 08.10.2017 to the respondent No.3 for releasing the seized property. The petitioners have given the property on lease to the orphanage for a monthly rent of Rs.41,000/-. The petitioner is put to loss since July 2017. There are several maintenance issues in the property. Learned Assistant Government Pleader for Women Development and Child Welfare Department submitted that the orphanage was seized for violation of the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and the National Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016. The petitioners should have checked the registration certificate of the orphanage before giving the property on rent or lease. The petitioners allowed the founder of the orphanage to run a home for children in need of care and protection illegally. The orphanage management did not submit original copies of the rental agreement at the time of inspection. The petitioner did not register the lease deed of the building at the concerned Sub-Registrar. FIR No.446 of 2017 was registered against Sunith Kumar, in-charge of the orphanage, under Section 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 and under Section 376-C and 506 IPC with L.B. Nagar Police Station. The seized movable and immovable property of the orphanage was kept in the building of the petitioners. As per the orders of the I Additional cum Metropolitan Sessions Judge, L.B. Nagar, action will be taken on the movable and immovable properties. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the petitioners are not the accused in FIR.No.446 of 2017. The petitioners are only the owners of the subject premises and the seizure is illegal. As such, there is no requirement for the petitioners to approach the concerned Court for release of the premises/property. It is not in dispute that the petitioners are the owners of the property and the orphanage is the tenant. The contention of the learned Assistant Government Pleader that the petitioners should have registered the lease deed and should have checked the antecedents of the orphanage before giving the property on lease is without any merit. The petitioners, being landlords, would only enquire whether the tenant has the capacity to pay the rents and also ensure that illegal activities are not carried out in the tenanted premises. The misuse of the tenanted property by the tenant and that too after the property was taken on lease cannot in any manner be attributed to the petitioners. The petitioners are not involved in the criminal case, so also the petitioners do not have any civil liability for the illegal activities committed by their tenant and as such, the seizure of the premises is ex facie illegal. However, as the property is stated to have been seized pursuant to registration of FIR.No.446 of 2017, it would be appropriate to dispose of the writ petition with the following directions: 1. The petitioners shall submit an application to the I Additional cum Metropolitan Sessions Judge, L.B. Nagar, seeking release of the subject premises, seized by the Village Revenue Officer, on the directions of the respondent No.4 on 24.06.2017 under the cover of panchanama. 2. The application filed by the petitioners shall be considered and appropriate orders shall be passed forthwith by the I Additional cum Metropolitan Sessions Judge, L.B. Nagar, releasing the subject premises of the petitioners by imposing reasonable conditions. 3. The documents, movable properties, articles etc. of the orphanage viz. Save a Child, shall be forthwith shifted by concerned police with due intimation to the I Additional District Judge cum Metropolitan Sessions Judge, L.B. Nagar and the same shall be kept in the custody of the police station or the Court or any other safe place in accordance with law. If necessary, permission of the Court shall be taken by the police for shifting the documents, movable properties, articles etc. The miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand closed. There shall be no order as to costs.",

    "Passage": "This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to quash the proceedings in Spl.C.C.No.210 of 2023 on the file of Special Court Tirunelveli. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioner had married the third respondent/victim, when she was 17 years old and the petitioner also had sexual intercourse with her. It came to the knowledge of the second respondent/defacto complainant and she lodged a complaint. Hence, the case has been registered as against the petitioners. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, learned Counsel appearing for the respondents No.1 & 2 and the learned Counsel appearing for the third respondent submitted that now, the petitioner and the second respondent/defacto complainant have settled the dispute between themselves amicably and the second respondent/defacto complainant is not willing to proceed further with the criminal case. The third respondent/victim had stated that both the petitioner and the third respondent/victim got married on 07.06.2021 and a male child was born to them on 22.03.2022. They are living happily in a separate house and she did not want to pursue with the case. The case has been registered for offences under Sections 9 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, and POCSO Act. However, the third respondent/victim confirmed that she is not inclined to prosecute this case further, since she married the petitioner. The Court ultimately decided to quash the criminal proceedings, agreeing with the terms of the joint compromise memo and the affidavit filed by the victim.",
    "Question": "Given the circumstances in the case of Vaithilingam vs The Sub Inspector of Police, where the victim has voluntarily stated that she does not wish to pursue the case after marrying the accused, how does the law typically handle situations where victims choose to withdraw complaints related to child marriage and sexual offences, especially in light of existing child protection laws?",
    "A": "The law requires that the victim's consent should be disregarded as the welfare of children is paramount.",
    "B": "The law allows the victim's request to withdraw cases if both parties amicably settle under certain conditions, especially if it prevents further legal issues.",
    "C": "The law mandates that all cases of child marriage must proceed regardless of the victim’s wishes.",
    "D": "The law only allows for a case dismissal if the child victim is above 21 years old.",
    "Correct Answer": "The law allows the victim's request to withdraw cases if both parties amicably settle under certain conditions, especially if it prevents further legal issues.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage states that the victim, now of legal age, and the petitioner have settled their dispute amicably and expressed a desire not to pursue the case. The court’s decision to quash the proceedings aligns with legal provisions allowing for the quashing of criminal charges when a mutual agreement exists among the parties, particularly in such sensitive matters."

    "Passage": "Sri. Shivakumara vs State By Basavapatna Police on 13 September, 2017. This criminal petition is filed under Section 438 of CR.P.C., praying to enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest in CR.No.47/2017 of Basavapatna P.S., Davanagere District for the offences P/U/S 9, 10, 11 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and Sec.10 of POCSO Act. The allegation is, the 1st petitioner married the complainant, now aged 17 years while she was 15 years of age. The marriage was celebrated on the Basava Jayanthi festival of 2015 and one year after the marriage, the complainant joined the husband and in-laws in the matrimonial home during April 2016. One month thereafter, the 2nd petitioner/mother-in-law used to complain against the complainant with her son and the 1st petitioner used to beat her. He used to come home in drunken condition, abuse her filthily and assault her. They harassed her to get away from the matrimonial home. When she was carrying pregnancy for three months, she was assaulted in the presence of her mother and thrown out of the matrimonial home. Her mother is a daily wager and since unable to maintain her, admitted her to Nirmala Hospital, Shivamogga, where she was provided shelter. The Doctor on coming to know her age as 17 years, took her to District Child Welfare Committee. She was in the Shelter Home and thereafter admitted to Mecgan Hospital, Shivamogga, for delivery. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners are from Sillekyathar community and child marriage is very common in their community. They are not aware of the legal impediment against child marriage. They are nomadic people. If the petitioners are arrested, in all probability, it will shut the door of compromise for ever. The offence invoked is under Section 10 of the POCSO Act which attracts punishment ranging between 3 years to 7 years. The sensitive question of child born from the marriage between the victim and 1st petitioner cannot be lost sight of. Though the complainant was a minor at the time of the marriage, it is not a marriage void-ab-initio, it is a voidable marriage. Being mindful of the consequence of the situation, this court is of the opinion that it is in the interest of the marriage that the petitioner shall be granted anticipatory bail for a limited period. The petitioners are granted anticipatory bail for a period of three weeks in Crime No.47/2017 registered by the respondent police.",
    "Question": "Considering the legal framework and societal context presented in the case of Sri. Shivakumara vs. State By Basavapatna Police, what are the potential consequences of granting bail under the POCSO Act for both the victims and the accused, especially in terms of child protection laws?",
    "A": "The accused would benefit significantly, as it allows them to avoid any consequences of the charges.",
    "B": "It could lead to threats against the victim, potentially preventing her from speaking out against the abuse.",
    "C": "The bail would not affect anyone since the laws do not recognize child marriage.",
    "D": "The victims would benefit as it opens avenues for mutual understanding among involved parties.",
    "Correct Answer": "It could lead to threats against the victim, potentially preventing her from speaking out against the abuse.",
    "Reasoning": "Given the nature of the accusations and the history of abuse outlined in the passage, granting bail to the accused can create an atmosphere of intimidation for the victim which may deter her from pursuing legal action against them."

    "Passage": "Pocso Act vs In Re: Narayan Halder on 27 March, 2023. In Re: An application for bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure filed on 13.02.2023 in connection with Tehatta Police Station Case No.451 of 2022 dated 04.06.2022 under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the POCSO Act. Report is placed on record. From the report it appears a panel of three special Public Prosecutors have been notified for the Special Court under POCSO Act at Tehatta sub-division. In view of the aforesaid development, we expect that the trial will proceed with utmost expedition. We have considered the materials on record. There are materials implicating the petitioner in the offence of penetrative sexual assault. Under such circumstances, we are not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner at this stage. The application for bail is thus rejected. Trial court is directed to consider the issue of framing of charge at the earliest and in the event charge is framed, to take the proceeding to its logical conclusion keeping in mind the mandate under Section 35(2) of the POCSO Act. In a number of cases it has come to our notice that adequate number of special Public Prosecutors have not been appointed to the POCSO courts. Section 32 of the POCSO Act requires appointment of special Public Prosecutors who have adequate experience and sensitivity to handle cases of gender violence against minors in POCSO courts. Appointment of competent and efficient Public Prosecutors is a sine qua non for protection of victim interest and effective administration of justice in POCSO cases. In Alarming Rise in the Number of Reported Child Rape Incidents, In re1 the Apex Court held as follows: \"8. There is a salutary reason for appointing Public Prosecutors exclusively for POCSO cases. Public Prosecutors must be trained to deal with child victims and child witnesses. They need to understand the psychology of children. They need to empathise with children. They need to know how to bring out the truth from children who are victims of sexual abuse and have to undergo the trauma again while recounting the traumatic experience. 9. The job assigned to the Public Prosecutor for POCSO cases is a very onerous one which must be carried out with great care and sensitivity. Therefore, not only is there a need to have exclusive Public Prosecutors but there is also a need to develop a training programme where these Special Public Prosecutors should be trained to deal with issues which will arise in their courts. These issues may not be confined to legal issues which otherwise Public Prosecutors may be trained to deal with. The issues may be psychological, health and other related issues. 10. Keeping in view these factors, we direct all the States who are present before us to take steps to appoint exclusive Public Prosecutors in all the courts which have been set up exclusively for POCSO cases. It may be relevant to note the expression 'Special Public Prosecutor' for every 'special court' does not bar the Government from notifying more than one special Public Prosecutor for a court in view of heavy pendency of cases in the file of each court. Reference in this regard may be made to Section 13(2) of General Clauses Act which reads as follows: \"13. Gender and number.- *** *** *** (1) *** *** *** (2) words in the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa.\" Paucity of adequate number of trained Special Prosecutors in POCSO courts requires to be immediately addressed. Legal Remembrancer is directed to submit report with regard to the following: (1) Number of Special Public Prosecutors appointed in each of the POCSO courts in the State of West Bengal; (2) Pendency of cases in each of the courts; (3) Breakup of cases in every court: (i) Where case is pending investigation; (ii) Where charge sheet has been filed; (iii) Where charges have been framed and/or trial has commenced.

    "Passage": "Polu Anil vs The State Of Telangana on 26 April, 2022. HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE K.SURENDER. CRIMINAL APPEAL No.43 OF 2020 JUDGMENT: 1. The appellant filed this appeal questioning the conviction recorded under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code and sentenced to undergo seven years simple imprisonment. However, the appellant was acquitted for the charges under Sections 354-A, 366-A of Indian Penal Code and Section 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO' Act). 2. Briefly stated, the case of the prosecution is that PW1 who is brother of the victim PW4 filed complaint Ex.P1 with the police stating that PW4 was missing and he suspected the appellant herein. According to prosecution case, the appellant took PW4 to a temple and tied gold 'pustela thadu' (sacred thread) around the neck of bride during marriage ceremony. Thereafter, PW4 and the appellant stayed at different places and nearly after ten days, the accused and PW4 were caught by the police. Thereafter, statement of PW4 was recorded by the Magistrate and the police. As per the statement given to the police and Magistrate under under section 164 CRPC marked as Ex.P4, PW4 stated that she was in love with the appellant and decided to marry him and went with the appellant on her own, taking one gold biscuit weighing six tulas. She told the appellant that they should elope and get married, accordingly, they went to Karimnagar in an auto and boarded a bus for Secunderabad and from Secunderabad they went to Thirupathi. Thereafter, they were caught by the police. On completion of investigation, the police filed charge sheet under Sections 366-A, 354 of Indian Penal Code and Section 12 of the POCSO Act, 2012. After the trial, the learned Sessions Judge found the appellant not guilty for the said charges, however, convicted the appellant under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code. 3. It is the specific case of PW4-victim that she was in love with the appellant and on her own she went with the appellant to Karimnagar and to Thirupathi where they got married and came back to Secunderabad. Neither in the statement made before the Court nor the statement made before the Magistrate under Ex.P4, did PW4 make any allegation of force against the appellant. Further, she stated during the chief-examination that accused did not make any sexual assault on her. 4. The learned Sessions Judge found that the girl was not a minor and the provisions of Section of POCSO Act did not attract. The trial Court also found that there was no allegation of any molestation for which reason, the trial Court found the appellant not guilty for the said offences. 5. Section 366 of Indian Penal Code reads as follows: \"366. Kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc.--Whoever kidnaps or abducts any woman with intent that she may be compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled, to marry any person against her will, or in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, or knowing it to be likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; 1 [and whoever, by means of criminal intimidation as defined in this Code or of abuse of authority or any other method of compulsion, induces any woman to go from any place with intent that she may be, or knowing that it is likely that she will be, forced or seduced to illicit intercourse with another person shall also be punishable as aforesaid].\" 6. Question of kidnapping or abducting does not arise when the evidence itself discloses that PW4 had taken six tulas of gold and asked the appellant to come along with him and on her own they went to Thirupathi and came back. There is not even a whisper for any kind of force or compulsion under which PW4 went along with the appellant for all the 15 days. 7. Having found that PW4 was not a child, having acquitted the appellant for the offences under POCSO Act and also having found that there was no outraging of modesty of victim girl, the trial Court ought to have acquitted the appellant. 8. As seen from the evidence none of the ingredients of Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code are made out and for the said reason, the appellant is liable to be acquitted of the charge under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code and accordingly, acquitted. The appeal is allowed setting aside the conviction of the appellant under Section 366 of IPC. Since the appellant is already on bail, the bail bonds shall stand cancelled. As a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending, shall stands closed.",

The petitioner is the mother of the victim child, who was also impleaded as an accused in the case registered by the Respondent/Police in Cr.No.5/22 of W-17, All Women Police Station, for the offences under Sections 9(m)(n) r/w10 of POCSO Act & 21(1) of POCSO Act, 2012. Heard the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the respondent police and perused the materials available on record. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the complaint was given by a CWC Member by name N.Lalitha; the allegation made in the complaint is that the victim child appeared disturbed at her school due to sexual abuse caused by her own father; she revealed the said facts to her teacher; on coming to know this, the Head Master of her School called the Child Help Line and thereafter the CWC members met the child, enquired her and filed this complaint; so far as the allegation against the petitioner is concerned, she did not report the occurrence to the police despite she had knowledge about the sexual abuse caused by her husband on her child. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent police submitted that despite the mother had the knowledge about the occurrence, she did not come forward to give a complaint and only because of that she had been impleaded as an accused. Since the defacto complainant has just set the law in motion and she is not the victim in this case, I feel it is sufficient to hear the learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent police on behalf of the State. The records would show that the mother has been impleaded as an accused in this case on the allegation that she did not report the sexual abuse caused to her own daughter, to the police. It is a sad case where the perpetrator happened to be the very father of the minor child. In this difficult situation, it is not easy for both the victim and her mother to take decision about the appropriate legal action against the accused, who stand in a very close relationship with them. Even according to the complaint the mother of the victim had enquired about this to her husband during February 2022. Though allegations were made that the child had informed the occurrence to her mother during February 2017, the 164 statement of the child would show that she had informed her mother only during February 2022. As stated already, due to the difficult and intimate relationship of the victim and the petitioner with the accused, it can not be inferred that the petitioner had an intention to suppress the occurrence. It is needless to state that in sexual offences, the complaint can be given with some delay. And that may be due to social stigma and familial integrity and all other associated. Though such kind of occurrence should be reported immediately, if the perpetrator happens to be the father of the victim child, the mother cannot be expected to give a complaint without making thorough enquiry and ascertaining the facts from every angle and that may take some time. The gap between the time when the victim informed her mother and the date of the complaint made by the CWC Member is not too long. Hence, I feel the petitioner deserves to be given with the benefit of doubt even at the threshold level without subjected to futher process. In the result, the Criminal Original Petition is allowed and the FIR in Cr.No.5/22 of W-17, All Women Police Station against the petitioner / A2 alone is quashed.",

Tomar, learned Public Prosecutor for the respondent - State.\nHeard on I.A. No.15174/2023, which is first application under Section 389(1) of Cr.P.C. moved on behalf of appellant No.1 - Child IN Conflict with law seeking suspension of sentence and grant of bail.\nAppellant stands convicted under Section 450 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 05 years RI with fine of Rs.500/-, under Section 328 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 05 years RI with fine of Rs.500/- and under Section 6 of POCSO Act read with Section 376(D) of IPC and sentenced to undergo 20 years' RI with fine of Rs.50,000/- with default stipulation vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 01.08.2023 passed by the Special Judge (POCSO Act), Bhind (Madhya Pradesh) in Special Case (ST No.) No.80/2021. As per prosecution story, while parents of the prosecutrix had gone away to attend a marriage, her brother and sister were sleeping on the terrace and she was sleeping in the courtyard on the ground floor, on 11.05.2019, at about 12 in the intervening night, accused - Jitendra, Rohit and present appellant (juvenile) entered the house from terrace area and caught hold the prosecutrix. She was dragged in a room, where she was forced to consume liquor, while present appellant-(juvenile) and another accused were standing outside the room. Main accused Jitendra committed rape on the prosecutrix. Accordingly, case has been registered. Upon filing of challan, the case was committed for trial to the Sessions Court. The Sessions Court upon critical evaluation of the evidence placed on record has convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred above. Learned counsel for the appellant at the first instance fairly submits that the appellant (juvenile) has already suffered the jail incarceration for almost three years. There is no allegation of either violating the personal liberty of the prosecutrix or committing rape. Instead, the sole allegation against him is that he entered the house and was standing outside the room, where she was sexually abused by the main accused Jitendra. As such the conviction of the appellant under Section 376(D) of IPC and 5(G) and 6 of POCSO is fully unwarranted and based on surmises and conjecture. The appellant even otherwise, has no criminal antecedents. It is further submitted that co-accused Rohit has already been granted bail by this Court and the case of the present appellant is akin to his case. Hence, prays for suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent-State opposes the application supporting the order impugned with the submission that the appellant and two accused persons had entered the house of the prosecutrix with common intention of commission of rape. The active participation is well specific from the story of the prosecution and the evidence placed on record during trial. Hence, no exception can be taken in the matter of suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Upon hearing counsel for the parties, though this Court refrains from commenting upon rival contentions touching merits of the matter but looking to nature of allegation and since the appellant is having no criminal record, the application deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, we allow the application and it is directed that the jail sentence of the appellant - (juvenile) shall remain suspended and he be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court subject to verification of factum regarding deposit of fine amount. Appellant is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court on 23.11.2023 and on other subsequent dates as may be fixed in this behalf with following further conditions:- (i) the concerned jail authorities are directed that before releasing the appellant, the medical examination of the appellant be conducted through the jail doctor and if it is prima facie found that she is having any symptoms of COVID-19, then the consequential follow up action or any further test required be undertaken immediately. If not, appellant shall be released on bail in terms of the conditions imposed in this order ; (ii) violation of conditions, State is free to apply for cancellation of bail. Accordingly, I.A. No.15174/2023 stands allowed and disposed of. Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of deciding the instant I.A. and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal.",
    "Question": "In the case of Child In Conflict With Law Through His Guardian vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh, can the juvenile appellant seek legal remedies to contest the conviction based on the absence of his direct involvement in the sexual assault? What are the potential mechanisms available under the law for a juvenile to appeal against such a conviction, especially in light of the POCSO Act and IPC mentioned in this case?",
    "A": "No, the juvenile has no legal right to appeal since he is convicted.",
    "B": "Yes, the juvenile can appeal based on his lack of direct participation and seek suspension of sentence under Section 389(1) of Cr.P.C.",
    "C": "Yes, the juvenile can only seek a pardon from the governor.",

This application for bail under Section 389(1) of the Cr.P.C. indicates the legal mechanism available for the juvenile to contest the conviction."

    "Passage": "CRR No.2085 of 2016 (O&M) Date of Decision: July 17, 2018 Dharambir ...Petitioner Versus State of Haryana and another ...Respondents CORAM:- HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE JAISHREE THAKUR Present:- Mr. S.S. Momi, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. P.P. Chahar, DAG Haryana. Mr. J.S. Mehndiratta, Advocate for respondents No.2 and 3. This is a criminal revision filed against the order dated 13.05.2016 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Sonepat, where the application filed by the petitioner-complainant under Section 216 of Code of Criminal Procedure for amendment in the charges, by way of framing the charge under Section 305 of Indian Penal Code instead of 306 of IPC and for further framing the charge under Section 376 of IPC and Sections 6, 8, 12 of the POCSO Act read with Section 120-B of IPC against the accused persons, has been dismissed. In short, the facts of the case are that FIR No.452 dated 05.09.2015 came to be registered under Section 306 read with Section 34 of IPC at Police Station Sadar, Sonipat against respondents No.2 and 3 herein on the complaint of petitioner-complainant that on 05.09.2015 at around 05.00 his daughter Deepika committed suicide due to threatening given by Hanni and his mother Suman (respondents No.2 and 3 herein). It was also alleged that when his daughter went to South Point School tour to Delhi, accused Hanni also reached there and did obscene act with his daughter. When his daughter Deepika returned back, she disclosed this incident to her mother, on which they narrated this matter to Hanni's family, but instead of rebuking her son, Hanni's mother insulted Deepika. Hanni's mother also went to South Point School and insulted his daughter Deepika. Deepika was very upset with the behaviour of Hanni and his mother Suman, compelling her to the extreme step of committing suicide. During the course of investigation, a suicide note was recovered from the lower/trouser worn by the deceased at the time of her death, which was sent to FSL for verification of handwriting of the deceased and as per the report of Forensic Science Laboratory, the handwriting on the suicide note is of the deceased. After completing the investigation, final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was filed in the court against respondents No.2 and 3 under Sections 306/34 of IPC and thereafter, the trial court framed the charges under Sections 306/34 of IPC by an order dated 11.12.2015. Thereafter, the petitioner-complainant moved an application under Section 216 Cr.P.C. for amendment of charge on the ground that since the deceased in the instant case was less than 18 years of age, she was a child, and therefore, charge under Section 305 of IPC is required to be framed instead of Section 306 of IPC, but the said application came to be dismissed on 27.01.2016. Thereafter, a supplementary challan was filed by the police under Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C containing documents, birth certificate of Deepika (deceased) and statement of her mother Ishwanti. After that, the petitioner-complainant filed another application under Section 216 of Cr.P.C. for amendment in the charges, by way of framing the charge under Section 305 of IPC instead of 306 of IPC and for further framing the charge under Section 376 of IPC and Sections 6, 8, 12 of the POCSO Act read with Section 120-B of IPC against the accused persons, which application came to be dismissed by the impugned order dated 13.05.2016. Mr. S.S. Momi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner argues that it is an admitted fact on the case file the date of birth of deceased Deepika was 09.11.2000 and on the date of the occurrence, the deceased was minor, aged about 14 years, at the time when she committed suicide. The age of the deceased is mentioned as 14 years on the postmortem report. It is contended that as per the suicide note, the accused committed 'jabardasti' with the deceased. Meaning thereby, the deceased was molested and sexually abused and as such, charges under Sections 305, 376 of IPC and Sections 6, 8, 12 of POCSO Act read with Section 120-B of IPC are made out against the accused. Mr. J.S. Mehndiratta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents No.2 and 3 argues that there is nothing on record to amend the charges already framed. It is submitted that the earlier application filed by the learned Public Prosecutor under Section 216 of Cr.P.C. for amendment of charge has already been dismissed by the trial court and the suicide note was already on the file at the time of framing of charges in the present case. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, apart from perusing the record. On the basis of the complaint filed by the petitioner-complainant and the investigation done by the police, final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was filed under Section 306 read with Section 34 of IPC. The earlier application moved under Section 216 Cr.P.C. came to be dismissed on 27.01.2016 by the trial court, while observing that there is no material pertaining to date of birth of the deceased in the form of birth certificate or in the statement of her father has been found. Thereafter, a supplementary challan came to be filed under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. containing the date of birth certificate of the deceased. However, the trial court has not said anything about the date of birth certificate of the deceased. The trial court further observed the suicide note prima facie makes out an offence under Section 306 of IPC, although the trial court did not consider the date of birth certificate of the deceased, submitted in the form of supplementary statement. Under these peculiar facts and circumstances, prima facie, at this stage, a case under Section 305 read with Section 34 of IPC is made out against the accused persons and the charge is required to be altered accordingly. In view of the above, the criminal revision in hand is partly allowed and the impugned order passed by the trial court is set aside to the above extent only.",
    "Question": "In light of the findings regarding Deepika's case, what legal steps should the victim's family consider pursuing given that the trial court has initially dismissed the application for the amendment of charges related to her status as a minor? What implications does this have for the application of child protection laws in these circumstances?",
    "A": "The victim's family should immediately reapply for the charges to be amended and seek legal counsel to navigate the complexities of child protection laws effectively.",
    "B": "The family should accept the trial court's decision and cease any further legal action to avoid complicating the case.",
    "C": "The family can only appeal to higher authorities if they present new evidence that contradicts the findings of the trial court.",
    "D": "They must gather public support before pursuing any further legal action regarding the case.",
    "Correct Answer": "The victim's family should immediately reapply for the charges to be amended and seek legal counsel to navigate the complexities of child protection laws effectively.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage states that the trial court dismissed the application for amending the charges related to Deepika's minor status, which indicates a failure to adequately address her victimization under child protection laws. Therefore, reapplying with proper legal guidance becomes critical to ensure appropriate action is taken in the interests of justice."

    "Passage": "The pith of the case against the petitioners demonstrated serious concerns relating to the sexual exploitation of minors, propelled by a context where the law is particularly stringent.

    "Question": "Reflecting on the court's decision in Rahul P.R. vs State Of Kerala, what key factors indicate that mutual settlements between the perpetrator and the victim do not suffice to quash allegations of serious offenses against children, according to judicial standards?",

    "B": "Legal standards maintain that serious offenses against children must be pursued independently of personal reconciliations to ensure justice and maintain societal norms.",
    "C": "The courts will quash the charges if the victim states that they have forgiven the accused.",
    "D": "Legally binding settlements in marriage may be considered sufficient grounds for quashing.",
    "Correct Answer": "Legal standards maintain that serious offenses against children must be pursued independently of personal reconciliations to ensure justice and maintain societal norms.",
    "Reasoning": "This solidifies a commitment to societal welfare and protection of minors, reflecting the enduring legal perspective that such serious allegations necessitate judicial scrutiny beyond personal relationships."

    "Passage": "In the context of child protection laws, the phrase 'commercial sexual exploitation of children' entails actions where any child is exploited for sexual purposes. This includes, but is not limited to, engaging a child in prostitution, child pornography, and such other activities that violate the dignity and rights of children, as enforced under the provisions of the POCSO Act.",
    "Question": "How do child protection laws, specifically concerning commercial sexual exploitation, provide a framework for the prosecution of offenders and ensuring justice for child victims?",
    "A": "The laws only classify offenses but do not help in actual prosecution or victims' recovery.",

    "C": "The laws focus solely on adult offenses and do not apply to children.",
    "D": "Child protection laws work mainly to rehabilitate offenders rather than to protect victims.",
    "Correct Answer": "Such laws provide a robust framework for the prosecution of perpetrators by defining specific offenses, outlining penalties, and mandating protective measures for victims to recover from their trauma.",
    "Reasoning": "Child protection laws are specifically designed to combat and prevent the exploitation of children while ensuring that those who perpetrate such offenses are held criminally accountable, thus facilitating justice and victim recovery."

    "A": "The exception can be applied if the girl claims to have consented, regardless of her age.",
    "B": "The exception is deemed invalid when considering the child protection laws like POCSO, which prioritize the victim's rights.",
    "C": "Providing bail is acceptable as long as the marriage occurred, regardless of the victim being underage.",
    "D": "Legal remedies should focus solely on getting the accused released irrespective of the child's consent.",
    "Correct Answer": "The exception is deemed invalid when considering the child protection laws like POCSO, which prioritize the victim's rights.",
    "Reasoning": "The court's decision highlights that the definitions and protections provided under child protection laws, particularly the POCSO Act, take precedence over Section 375 of IPC, indicating that consent from a child under 18 is not legally valid, thus emphasizing the need to protect the victim's rights."

This legal precedent establishes that detention for juveniles must focus on their welfare and societal reintegration rather than similar punitive measures applied to adults.",
    "Question": "Considering the court's judgment that juvenile detention should prioritize rehabilitation over punishment and the inapplicability of Section 436-A of the Cr.P.C., what legal options are available to a Child in Conflict with Law seeking a reduction or termination of their detention period?",

The litigation revolves around the examination of whether proper procedures were observed in taking cognizance of the complaint against the accused. Various judgments indicate that a magistrate must not only be able to act on police reports or complaints but must also ensure the existence of sufficient grounds for the initiation of proceedings.

Mr. Naval Kishore Gupta - learned counsel for appellant. Mr. Rajeev Upadhyay - Public Prosecutor for respondent - State. Heard on I.A. No.17030/2023, which is second application under Section 389 (1) of Cr.P.C. for suspension of sentence and grant of bail filed on behalf of appellant- Deepak Rajak. Appellant stood convicted under Section 363 of IPC r/w 3(2)(v-a) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (in short, Act), Section 366 of IPC r/w 3(2)(v) of the Act and 376(3) r/w 3(2)(v) of the Act and sentenced to undergo two years RI with fine of Rs.1,000/-, imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.1,000/- and imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.2,000/- with default stipulation respectively vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 24.11.2022 passed by Special Judge (POCSO Act 2012), Shivpuri (M.P.) in S.C. No.90/2021. Appellant so far has undergone incarceration of three years and two months. A s per prosecution story, an FIR was lodged on 29.02.2020 by the prosecutrix accompanied by her parents and brother to the effect that on 26.01.2020 while her father was ill and her mother & sister had gone to the field and she was alone at the home, the present appellant, who was her neighbour, came to her house. He made false promise of marriage and thereafter manipulated her and she was subjected to sexual abuse. Besides, the appellant had taken her to Jhansi and went to take the ticket while leaving her at Jhansi platform. Thereafter, the prosecutrix came back home by traveling in the bus. On such allegations, the investigation was started. Upon completion of investigation, challan was filed and the case was committed to the Sessions Court for Trial. The Sessions Court after proper evaluation of evidence placed on record convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above. Learned counsel for the appellant, while taking exception to the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence submits that the appellant is innocent and has been falsely implicated. It is a case of consent. The prosecutrix on her own volition had gone with the appellant. There is delay of one month in lodging of FIR. There is no medical evidence which supports the case of prosecution. As per Ex.D-5, medical ossification report, her age is 16-18 years. The prosecutrix's father PW-15 himself stated that date-of-birth of the prosecutrix was mentioned in the school record on hypothetical basis, for which they have no record. In the aforesaid circumstances, the impugned judgment is based on surmises and conjectures and suffers from vice of perversity. The appellant has already suffered incarceration of 3 years and 2 months. There is no likelihood of the early disposal of the appeal in the near future. Under such circumstances, learned counsel for the appellant prays that benefit of suspension of sentence may be extended to present appellant. Per contra, learned counsel for the State while supporting the impugned judgment opposes the suspension application and prays for its rejection with submission that the date-of-birth of the prosecutrix was 10.06.2007 and the incident took place on 26.01.2020 and thus, at that time she was 14 years of age, therefore, her consent is irrelevant. It is a case of manipulation and sexual abuse of a minor child at the hands of the present appellant. Hence no exception can be taken in the impugned judgment for suspension of sentence. Upon hearing learned counsel for the parties, though this Court refrains from commenting upon the rival contentions so advanced touching the merits of the case, but regard being had to the fact that that present appellant so far has suffered incarceration of 03 years and 02 months and there is no likelihood of early hearing of the appeal, in the obtaining facts and circumstances, appellant is held entitled to suspension of jail sentence. Accordingly, I.A.No.17030/2023 stands allowed and it is directed that jail sentence of appellant shall remain suspended during pendency of the present appeal and he shall be released on bail subject to verification of the factum of depositing the fine amount and on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lacs only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. He is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court first on 07.12.2023 and on other subsequent dates as may be fixed in this behalf. Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of deciding the instant I.A. and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal.

HOSDURG POLICE STATION, KASARGOD DISTRICT. R BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI.AJITH MURALI THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 16-03-2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ORDER 1. This petition seeking an order of pre-arrest bail is preferred by the accused in Crime No.42 of 2018 of the Hosdurg Police Station, registered under Sections 366 and 377 of the Indian Penal Code and under Sections 5(I), (m) and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO'). 2. The aforesaid crime was registered on the basis of information furnished by a minor girl who was studying in the IV Standard. She used to travel to the School in the autorickshaw of the petitioner herein. The child in her statement has stated in clear and unambiguous terms that while she was in the III and IV standard, the petitioner used to sexually assault her on multiple occasions. It is further alleged that on 11.1.2018, the victim was taken to the residential home of the petitioner herein and after removing her clothes, she was subjected to gross sexual abuse. 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the allegations are without basis. According to the learned counsel, even if the allegations are admitted as such, offence under Section 5 r/w. Section 6 of the Act will not be made out. It is further alleged that other crimes have also been registered at the instance of the minor child which would render her case against the petitioner suspect. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer. It is submitted that the medical examination report of the victim reveal that she was subjected to sexual abuse. 5. I have considered the submissions advanced. 6. Having regard to facts and circumstances, the contention of the learned counsel that the petitioner is totally innocent cannot be countenanced. The medical certificate of the injured sufficiently corroborates the case of the prosecution. In that view of the matter, it does not appear to me that this Court will be justified in arming the petitioner with an order of pre-arrest bail. 7. However, the learned counsel prays for a direction that the petitioner be allowed to surrender before the jurisdictional court. I do not see any need for issuance of any such directions. The petitioner shall surrender as expeditiously as possible and if an application for bail is filed, the same shall be considered and orders shall be passed on its merits. This petition will stand dismissed.",

    "Correct Answer": "The minor girl is entitled to support services, and law enforcement can collect and preserve evidence in accordance with POCSO.",

OTHER PRESENT: SRI.C.N.PRABHAKARAN-SENIOR PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 03.04.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bail Appl..No. 124 of 2019 ORDER Apprehending his arrest, petitioner seeks anticipatory bail under Sec.438 of Cr.P.C. He is alleged to have committed offences punishable under Sec.354 of IPC, Sec.8 of the PoCSO Act and Sec.75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act ( JJ Act for short). The police of Enathu police station in Pathanamthitta district has registered a case as crime no.1641/2018 against the petitioner. Prosecution case goes as follows: It all happened at around 1 p.m on 21.12.2018. The victim girl aged 16 years was returning from her school along with her friends. When they reached Karimpara junction, the petitioner who came on a scooter abused the girl. He caught her hand. When she objected, he slapped on her face twice. Heard Sri.K.Shaj, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri.C.N.Prabhakaran, the learned senior public prosecutor. It seems that Sec.75 of the JJ Act is out of question. Sec.75 provides punishment for cruelty to child. In order to attract Sec.75, the offender must be a person who is in actual charge of or control over the victim child. The prosecution has no such case. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that catching the hand or slapping on the face do not attract the penal provisions in Sec.354 of IPC. It is also alleged that Sec.8 of the PoCSO Act is not attracted inasmuch as the acts alleged against the petitioner do not fall within the ambit of the definition of sexual assault contained in Sec.7 of the PoCSO Act. It is also the submission of the learned counsel that there is no allegation against the petitioner that he touched any parts of the body of the girl specifically referred to in Sec.7. It is also his submission that catching the hand and slapping on the face cannot be termed as an act with sexual intent. It is too premature to have a positive or negative finding on the arguments of the learned counsel. But his arguments cannot be totally ignored or brushed aside. I do not consider the present case to be one where custodial interrogation of the petitioner is an absolute must for an effective investigation of the case. Considering all these matters, I am inclined to grant him bail. The application is allowed. If arrested in connection with crime no.1641/2018 of Enathu police station, the petitioner shall be released on bail, after interrogation, on his executing a bond for Rs 75,000/- (seventy five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the investigating officer. The petitioner shall co-operate with the investigation. He shall make himself available for interrogation if so required by the investigating officer. He shall report to the investigating officer between 10 am and 11 am on every Saturday for a period of three months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. The petitioner shall not intimidate or try to influence witnesses. He shall not destroy or tamper with evidence. The court having jurisdiction is hereby empowered to cancel the bail in accordance with law if any of the conditions mentioned above is violated. If the petitioner surrenders before the court concerned, this order will cease to have effect and the said court will pass appropriate orders as if this order has not been passed. A.M.BABU 03/04/19 JUDGE",

BY ADV.SRI.M.T.SURESHKUMAR RESPONDENT(S)/COMPLAINANT: STATE OF KERALA, REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM-682031. R BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SMT.V.SREEJA THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 19-06-2018, THE COURT ON 25/6/2018 PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ORDER The accused in Crime No. 548/2018 of Ottappalam Police station for offences punishable under sections 7 & 8 of POCSO Act 2012 and under section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act 2015, are the petitioners herein. Admitted facts are as follows; The first petitioner had married the defacto complainant on 27/4/2009. Thereafter, they resided together for some time. The second petitioner is his father and the third petitioner is his mother. A girl child was born, who is aged 7 years now. Matrimonial dispute arose between the parties. It is stated that, on 5/9/2017, the wife left the matrimonial home. The child was in the custody of the petitioners till 15/9/2017, on which day the child was entrusted with the parents of the defacto complainant. The present complaint was laid by the wife alleging that the first petitioner had sexually abused the seven year old girl on few days between 5/9/2017 to 15/9/2017 at the matrimonial home and other places. Apprehending arrest, the petitioners herein have approached this court. The specific contention of the petitioners herein is that, the defacto complainant was a quarrelsome person and matrimonial relationship became incompatible. It was alleged that, the defacto complainant had developed a close intimacy with one doctor who was younger to her. She was found making secret audio and video calls to him over the mobile phone. When the relationship went beyond a limit, the husband intervened and she was warned. It was later understood that she continued to maintain even physical relationship with him. On being confronted with materials, she is stated to have abandoned the child and left the matrimonial home on 5/9/2017. Thereafter, the first petitioner herein entrusted the child to the defacto complainant and her parents, considering the education of the child. The first petitioner herein initiated matrimonial proceedings, including an application for custody of the child. The present complaint was filed belatedly raising absolutely false allegations with the intention of denying him the custody of the child. It was vehemently contended that, the first petitioner herein has not committed any sexual abuse on the minor girl and it was purposefully and belatedly set up. Annexure A1 is a copy of the petition in O.P.(HMA) No. 649/2017 dated 27/10/2017 filed by the first petitioner herein before the Family Court, Malappuram. He claimed divorce on the ground of adultery of the defacto complainant with the doctor, who was arrayed as the second respondent in that O.P. It was alleged therein that, she was having continuous physical relationship with that doctor and was caught with evidence. Annexure A2 is a copy of O.P.( G & W) No. 356/2018 filed by the first petitioner herein on 24/5/2018 before the Family Court, Malappuram claiming custody of the child. Thereafter, Crime was got registered by the wife at Bangalore as Crime No. 703/2017 on 11/12/2017 against the petitioners herein alleging matrimonial cruelty. The first petitioner sought bail which was granted by Annexure A3 order. It is seen that, she alleged that the petitioners herein committed acts of matrimonial cruelty and demanded dowry and thereby committed offences punishable under section 498A IPC and the provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The petitioner was granted anticipatory bail. Annexure A5 is a complaint filed by the defacto complainant before the State Commission for Protection of Child Child Rights of Kerala and Karnataka, with copies to the various authorities. It was alleged that, the father-in-law of the defacto complainant had made sexual advances towards her. She alleged that, in-laws had administered various medicines on her body. It was also alleged that, the child was physically assaulted by the petitioners during the period from 5/9/2017 to 15/9/2017. There is an allegation that, the grandfather used to beat her on her groin and grandmother had beaten the child with a chapathy rolling pin. Annexure A6 is the complaint No.20/2018 filed on 24/1/2018 by the defacto complainant under the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. The above documents clearly show that, at no point of time earlier, the defacto complainant had a case that the child was sexually abused by the father. Even though physical assault is alleged against the petitioners, there was absolutely no reference anywhere that the child was subjected to sexual abuse by the father. It seems that, for the first time such a complaint is seen raised in the present crime(Crime No.548/2018 of Ottappalam Police station). Crime was thereupon registered for offences punishable under sections 7 & 8 of POCSO Act and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act 2015. The crux of the allegation in the FIS is that, during the period when the child was in the custody of the petitioners, the father of the child used to give her a bath. He used to undress her, remove his dress and give her bath. It was stated that in the course of bathing her, the first petitioner used to tickle her. The child has stated that, she did not like boys giving her bath. Pursuant to it, section 164 Cr.P.C.statement of the victim was also recorded, which is substantially in tune with FI statement. It is pertinent to note that the only allegation raised against the first petitioner is as above. Even if the entire statement made by the child is taken at its face value, crucial question that arises is whether the father had any sexual intent while giving the daughter a bath. This has to be appreciated in the background that the allegation comes only at a highly belated stage, when the father himself had sought custody of the child. No explanation is forthcoming for the delay in giving complaint. Hence, the question to be investigated by the police is only whether the first petitioner herein with sexual intention had committed any act. For that, custodial interrogation does not appear to be warranted. It is also clear that, in such a very strained matrimonial relationship a belated allegation of this nature has to be considered carefully and it may not be safe to order custodial interrogation. Having regard to the above, I am inclined to grant benefit of anticipatory bail to the petitioners herein subject to the following conditions: i). Petitioners shall appear before the investigating officer within ten days from today and shall undergo interrogation. Thereafter, if they are proposed to be arrested, they shall be released on bail on each of the petitioner executing a bond for a sum of Rs.50,000/-(Rupees fifty thousand only) with two sureties for the like sum each. ii). They shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when called for and co-operate with the investigation. Anticipatory Bail Application is allowed.",
    "Question": "In light of the legal provisions under the POCSO Act and the findings in the passage, what steps need to be taken to protect the interests and rights of the minor child involved, while considering the allegations presented regarding the father and other family members?",

    "B": "An investigation must be conducted to clarify the intentions behind the allegations made by the defacto complainant before deciding on custody.",

    "Reasoning": "The passage states that the allegations were made belatedly and there lacks substantial evidence for sexual abuse. An investigation is necessary to ensure the child's welfare and to clarify the context of the accusations before any decision regarding custody is taken."

    "Passage": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS DATED: 27-04-2016 CORAM: THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE P.DEVADASS Crl.M.P.No.3669 of 2016 in Crl.A.No.235 of 2016 Suresh .. Petitioner -vs- State Represented by The Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station-Udhagamandalam, Udhagamandalam, Nilgiris District. (Crime No.1 of 2015) .. Respondent Petition filed under Section 389(1) of Cr.P.C., to suspend the sentence of imprisonment passed in Spl. S.C.No.4 of 2015 dated 27.11.2015 by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Udhagamandalam, Nilgiris District and release the petitioner on bail pending disposal of the Criminal Appeal. For Petitioner : Mr.J.T.Rajasuriya For Respondent : Mr.P.Govindarajan, Additional Public Prosecutor. O R D E R The sole accused in the Special Sessions Case in Spl. S.C.No.4 of 2015 on the file of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Nilgiris District at Udhagamandalam seeks suspension of his sentence of imprisonment. In the said Court, after trial, the trial Court convicted the accused under Section 7 read with Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (hereinafter POCSO Act) and sentenced him 3 years R.I. and fined him Rs.5,000/- and directed him to pay a compensation of Rs.1,00,000/-, i/d 2 years RI. The learned Judge also directed him payment of further compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- out of Victim Assistance Fund. PW-2 is the daughter of PW-1. The accused has been prosecuted for he having sexually abused her. The Trial Court believed her and construed his act as a sexual assault and thus convicted and sentenced him as stated above. The learned counsel for the petitioner/appellant would contend that the petitioner as well as the accused fancied each other. They fell in love. To distance him from her daughter, PW-1 had engineered this case. The prosecution version is the concocted brainchild of PW-1 in an unholistic alliance with the obliging police. The learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that in this case the two instances of occurrence have been projected. However, on this aspect, there is material contradictions as between the mother (P.W.1) and the daughter/P.W.2. It is PW-1 vs. PW-2. The learned counsel for the petitioner would also contend that top of it, there is material variation in the testimony of PW-2 before and during trial. Before trial before a Magistrate under Section 164 Cr.P.C. So also in her police statement. P.Ws.-2 and 1 were inconsistent as to the alleged date of occurrence, more particularly, PW-1 introduces a date, namely, 5.3.2015 which is nobody's case. 5.3.2015 was not uttered either by PW-2 nor prosecution. Thus, PW-1's version is a coloured version. In such circumstances, placing implicit reliance on the testimony of PWs-1 and 2 and inflict punishment upon the accused is too dangerous. Thus, there is prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. He will not run away. He has no bad history/antecedents. In the circumstances, he may be granted appeal bail. On the other hand, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that the Court can keep aside PW-1 because she is not the victim and focus its attention mainly on the victim/PW-2. Her evidence is crystal clear that the accused prayed on PW-2 like a vulture. He committed the inhuman act upon a minor child. Her solemn statement as to the sexual violence committed upon her. There is no significant reason for PW-1 as against the accused to implicate the accused risking the life and future of unmarried school going minor daughter. Very grave allegations are made as against the accused. There is no prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. This case is not a fit case for the grant of appeal bail. I have anxiously considered the rival submissions, perused the Trial Court's judgment and the piece of evidence referred to by both sides. In the facts and circumstances, now the question is whether the petitioner could be granted appeal bail under Section 389(1) Cr.P.C. Regular bail in a non-bailable offence in fit cases are being granted by the Magistrates under Section 437 Cr.P.C. While other Courts and the High Court exercises concurrent jurisdiction to grant bail in non-bailable cases under Section 439 Cr.P.C. The remand prisoners, under-trials could seek bail under the said provisions during pre-conviction stage of a criminal case. During that stage, it is pertinent to note that the presumption of innocence of an accused is intact because everyone is presumed to be innocent till the guilt alleged against the accused is proved beyond all reasonable doubts. However, once conviction is recorded, the said presumption is replaced by a Criminal Court judgment. Thereafter, also the conviction person can seek bail under Section 389 (1) Cr.P.C. Thus, the consideration for the grant of bail to an accused during the pre-conviction stage (before judgment) and post-conviction stage (after judgment) are different. So far as appeal bail under Section 389(1) Cr.P.C. is concerned, the Court has to find out is there any prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. While doing so, the Court should not indulge in meticulous examination of the evidence of the accused because the main appeal is not heard. It is still pending. To find out the prima facie case, the Trial Court has to refer to the findings recorded by the trial Court and the relevant evidence referred to. Further, it must also take into account the nature of the accusation made as against the accused. In view of the large scale violence committed upon the children, in 2012, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (Act No.32 of 2012) has been enacted. It is a Central Act. It contains provisions ensuring confidentiality of the victim of the offence, her family details and also conducting of the trial in a child friendly atmosphere and it had also introduced a legal fiction as to the criminal propensity, mental faculty of the accused, through Sections 29 and 30(1) of the Act. However, under Section 30(2), the Act one's right of presumption of innocence until he is otherwise held guilty by legal evidence has been preserved. Thus, it is Indianised version of admixture of English Criminal Law (Common System of Law) and French Criminal Law (Continental System of Law). Now, in a prosecution launched under POCSO Act, age of the victim is very important because only upon the victim being below 18 years that she is a 'child' the stringent provisions of POCSO Act will apply and consent of the victim being immaterial under POCSO Act. POCSO Act is much more wider in scope in prosecuting an accused than prosecuting accused under Section 376 IPC. In this case, start of the offence was stated to be on 21.2.2015 in the house of PW-1, when her mother was away. During that time, PW-2 was studying VIII Standard in a school. It is stated that then she was 13 years old. Ex.P-3 School Certificate, Ex.P-8 Medical Certificate, Ex.P-9 age Certificate and the evidence of PW-7 School Headmaster and PW-5 Doctor beyond pale of any controversy establishes that at the time when the alleged occurrence took place, she was below 18 years. So she is a child within the meaning of Section 2(d) of POCSO Act. So the provisions of POCSO Act became applicable to this case. PW-2 is stated to be the victim of a sexual violence. Her evidence shall be treated as the evidence of an injured witness. If her evidence is consistent, cogent, unimpeachable unless there are acceptable reasons to implicate the accused, her evidence can be acted upon. The question of looking for corroboration for her evidence arises when her evidence appears to be murky. This is a rule of prudence and not a rule of law. Thus, corroboration cannot be insisted upon as a condition precedent to act on the testimony of a victim in a sexual violence case. But while appreciating their evidence, the Court must fathom out the reality of the situation and the truth of the allegations. While doing so, the Court cannot mistake every difference in evidence as a material contradiction. It cannot go blow out a contradiction beyond proportion. It cannot mistook a mole a mountain. In a sexual violence case, honour of two persons, namely, the victim as well as the accused is involved. When the allegations are very serious, the Court must be very serious of proving those allegations. Even to impute culpable mental state to the accused, there must be some material for the Court to have reason to believe the existence of such a fact (See Sections 29 and 30(2) of POCSO Act, 2012). Now, in this case, PW-2 the minor child had the countenance of the accused, a Book-Seller for the first time when he came to their house to market his books. PW-1 forewarned him not to visit again since there are ladies in her house. According to PW-2, on the fateful day, namely, on 21.2.2015, at about 2 p.m., while she was alone in her house, the accused came, pressed her breasts, pushed her to the bed, sexually abused her private parts by placing his private part. Subsequently, on 28.3.2015 around 2 p.m., when again the accused came to her house with similar motive, PW-2 raised alarm, the accused took to his heels, PW-1 came, PW-2 recounted the whole incident and also the earlier incident that took place on 21.2.2015. Thereafter, police complaint was lodged. Thereafter, medical examination was conducted and there was no presence of external injuries on her private part. It is pertinent to note that the actual physical violence was not on 28.3.2015. Even as per the version of PW-2, it was on 21.2.2015 and thus, by the time the medical examination was conducted more than a month had passed away, the evidence on her person had fade away. PW-2, being a child was under extreme trauma, normally a child like her, when placed in such grim situation, will not be forthcoming and will try to hide the shame. But, in this case, as per PW-2 when again the accused attempted to make her sexual assault on her, unable to put up with the shame, she cried and the accused was caught. Reading the evidence of PWs-2 and 1 and other witnesses and the complaint, the substratum of the case that the accused on the first occasion had sexually assaulted the victim has been brought out by the prosecution. The attempt of the defence to dilute the effect of the said evidence by clinging to some difference in the evidence of PWs-1 and 2 and in the statement of the victim girl recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. which are not so material and are not significant enough to shake the veracity of the testimony of the victim girl has not been shattered by this adventure of the defence which has become a misadventure. Further, there is no convincing reason or motive supported by any material or acceptable reason to view the evidence of PW-2 with a jaundiced eye. The nature of the allegations made as against the accused is very serious. Thus, the fallout is that there is no prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. Thus, I am not inclined to grant him appeal bail. In view of the foregoings, this petition is dismissed. However, it is made clear that the observations made in this order are only for the purpose of finding out a prima facie case to take a decision in this petition and it has nothing to do with the disposal of the main Criminal Appeal.",
    "Question": "What does the legal interpretation of the statements made during the trial and their compared differences reveal about the credibility of the victim's testimony in sexual offenses against minors as outlined in the passage, and how are potential contradictions evaluated by the court?",

    "B": "Minor inconsistencies may not be significant enough to undermine the victim's credibility.",
    "C": "All discrepancies in testimonies are treated as major contradictions requiring dismissal of the case.",

    "Reasoning": "The passage explains that while the court must evaluate the credibility of testimonies in a sexual violence case, not every minor difference in evidence constitutes a material contradiction. Rather, the court must determine the substantiality of the evidence and its coherence to ascertain the truth of the allegations against the accused."

When the victim girl was taken into confidence, she narrated that after the applicant entered into the toilet and he latched the door, she was kissed by him on her lips and he also inappropriately touched her chest and her private part. He also threatened that if she informed about the said incident, she would have to meet with dire consequences. Thereafter, he opened the door of the toilet and left her. Based on the said narration, the complainant approached the police station on 19th April 2019 about the incident which took place on 17th April 2019 and lodged the FIR. The victim was forwarded for medical examination and was examined on 20th April 2019 after obtaining her consent. The history of the sexual assault narrated by the victim's mother is in sync with what she had disclosed to her mother about the applicant forcibly kissing her and fondling her breast. It is categorically recorded that she did not report any sexual intercourse. The child was medically examined and the opinion in column no.11 recorded as ‘multiple old healed hymenal tears’.

    "Passage": "Deepu B @ Kuttan vs State Of Kerala Represented By Public Prosecutor on 21 August, 2020. This Bail Application filed under Section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code was heard through Video Conference. The Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.263 of 2020 of Hosdurg Police Station, Kasargod District. The above case is registered against the petitioner alleging offences punishable under Section 376AB of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) r/w. Sections 6 r/w 5(m)(n) of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). The petitioner is in custody from 20.6.2020 onwards. The prosecution case is that, on 1.4.2020, the accused sexually abused a minor girl aged 4 ½ years by touching the genital organ of the victim. It is the case of the defacto complainant, the mother of the victim girl that, the child complained about a pain on her private parts and when the defacto complainant enquired about the same, the child disclosed to the defacto complainant that the petitioner committed the above activities. The alleged incident happened on 1.4.2020. The F.I. statement was given on 12.5.2020. The petitioner was arrested on 20.6.2020. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned public prosecutor. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, the petitioner is innocent in this case. The counsel submitted that, this is a false case foisted against the petitioner by the mother of the victim. The counsel submitted that, there is some difference of opinion between the defacto complainant and her husband. The petitioner is a close relative of the husband of the defacto complainant. The counsel submitted that, the petitioner supported the husband of the defacto complainant when there was a dispute between the defacto complainant and her husband. According to the petitioner, at that time, the defacto complainant threatened that, she will foist a false case against the petitioner. The counsel submitted that, the husband of the defacto complainant filed an affidavit before this Court. The counsel submitted that, in the affidavit, it is stated by the father of the victim, who is the husband of the defacto complainant that, this is a false case foisted against the petitioner. The father of the victim clearly stated that the petitioner is innocent in this case. The learned public prosecutor seriously opposed this bail application. The public prosecutor submitted that the allegations against the petitioner are very serious. The allegation is that, the petitioner committed sexual assault on a minor girl aged 4 ½ years. The public prosecutor submitted that the petitioner is not entitled orders under Section 439 Cr.P.C. at this stage. After hearing both sides, I think, this bail application can be allowed, on stringent conditions. Admittedly, the petitioner is in custody from 20.6.2020 onwards. The alleged incident happened on 1.4.2020 and the F.I.statement was given only on 12.5.2020. Admittedly, there is some matrimonial dispute between the defact complainant and her husband. It is also an admitted fact that, the petitioner is a close relative of the husband of the defact complainant. It is true that, an affidavit is filed by the father of the victim girl exonerating the petitioner from the allegation. I do not want to make any observation about the contents in the affidavit at this stage. This is a matter to be investigated by the investigating officer. Considering the entire facts and circumstances of this case, I think, this bail application can be allowed on stringent conditions. There can be a direction to the petitioner not to enter the jurisdictional limit of Hosdurg Police Station till a final report in Crime No.263 of 2020 of Hosdurg Police Station, is filed. Moreover, considering the need to follow social distancing norms inside prisons so as to avert the spread of the novel Corona Virus Pandemic, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Re: Contagion of COVID-19 Virus In Prisons case (Suo Motu Writ Petition(C) No.1 of 2020) and a Full Bench of this Court in W.P(C)No.9400 of 2020 issued various salutary directions for minimizing the number of inmates inside prisons. Moreover, it is a well accepted principle that, the bail is the rule and the jail is the exception. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chidambaram P. v. Directorate of Enforcement observed that, the basic jurisprudence relating to bail remains the same inasmuch as the grant of bail is the rule and refusal is the exception so as to ensure that the accused has the opportunity of securing fair trial. Considering the dictum laid down in the above decision and considering the facts and circumstances of this case, this Bail Application is allowed with the following directions: 1. The petitioner shall be released on bail on executing a bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the jurisdictional Court; 2. The petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer for interrogation as and when required. The petitioner shall co-operate with the investigation and shall not, directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer; 3. The petitioner shall not leave India without permission of the jurisdictional Court; 4. The petitioner shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused, or suspected, of the commission of which he is suspected; 5. The petitioner shall not enter the jurisdictional limit of Hosdurg Police Station, except for the purposes mentioned above, till a final report in Crime No.263 of 2020 of Hosdurge Police Station is filed. 6. The petitioner shall strictly abide by the various guidelines issued by the State Government and Central Government with respect to keeping of social distancing in the wake of Covid 19 pandemic; 7. If any of the above conditions are violated by the petitioner, the jurisdictional Court can cancel the bail in accordance to law, even though the bail is granted by this Court.

Based on the said letter, the complainant has lodged the complaint as per Ex.P7 and case has been registered by the Investigation Officer and charge sheet has been filed against the accused. 3. As soon as charge sheet was filed and the prosecution papers were made available to the accused as required under section 207 of Criminal Procedure Code, the learned counsel appearing for the accused and the learned Public Prosecutor were heard regarding the framing of charge under section 354 and 376 Indian Penal Code and 5(L)(M) R/w. 6 of POCSO Act 2012. Charge was framed and read over and explained to the accused. Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Therefore the case was posted for evidence of the prosecution. 4. In order to prove the alleged offences the prosecution examined 6 Witness as PWs 1 to 6 and documents have been marked as per Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.7. No incriminating articles have been marked. 5. Heard Learned Public Prosecutor for the state, and learned counsel appearing for the accused. 6. Now the point that arise for my consideration are: 1) Whether prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt: (a) That accused since from 2 years attempted to outrage the modesty of the victim girl by showing obscene videos and thereby committed the offence Punishable U/sec.354 of Indian Penal Code? (b) That since from one year accused committed rape against the victim girl against her will and thereby committed the offence Punishable U/sec. 376 of Indian Penal Code? (c) That accused had sexually assaulted the victim girl aged below 12 years and thereby committed the offence Punishable U/sec. 5(L) R/w.6 POCSO Act 2012? (d) That accused committed sexual assault against the victim girl more than once and thereby committed the offence Punishable U/ sec. 5(M) R/w.6 of POCSO Act? 2) What Order? 7. My findings above points are as under:- Point No.1 (a) : In the negative Point No.1 (b) : In the negative Point No.1 (c) : In the negative Point No.1 (d) : In the negative Point No.2 : as per final Order REASONS 8. Point No.1(a) to (d):- All the points are taken up together as they are inter related to each other. 9. The burden is on the prosecution to prove that accused since from one year back accused committed sexual assault against the victim girl Cw2 against her will and since from 2 years accused used to touch her body and used to show obscene videos and misbehaved with her. 10. Now let me consider the other oral evidence adduced by the prosecution. 11. Pw1 victim girl deposed in her evidence that she has not given statement before the police alleging that accused misbehaved with her and committed sexual assault and she is not aware of the contents written in Ex.P1 and Ex.P2, wherein she put her signature. She also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and she denied that she has lodged complaint as per Ex.p2 alleging that accused misbehaved with her and committed sexual assault and raped her and police drew mahazer as per Ex.P1. She also denied that she has given statement before the police as per Ex.P3 stating that accused misbehaved with her and committed rape showing obscene videos. She also stated that Ex.P2 is not in her hand writing and she only signed Ex.P2. 12. Pw2 Bhavani Devi mother of the victim girl deposed that she has not given statement before the police regarding the alleged incident. The said witness is also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and she has given statement before the police as per Ex.P4 stating that she came to know the accused misbehaved with the victim girl and sexually harassed her. 13. Pw3 Balaram deposed in his evidence that victim girl is his sister's daughter. He has not given statement before the police that accused misbehaved with the victim girl. The said witness is also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and he denied that he has given statement before the police that he came to know that accused misbehaved with the Pw2 and sexually harassed her. 14. Pw4 Ravi Kumar who is a mahazer witness deposed in his evidence that he put his signature to mahazer Ex.P1 about one year back in Subramanyapura police station and not known the contents. He also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and he denied that police drew the mahazer on 07.11.2014 at House No.27, 1st floor, Byraveswara Nilaya, ABM colony, Bangalore and after knowing the contents of the mahazer, he has signed and deposing falsely. 15. Pw5 Annappa who is also mahazer witness deposed in his evidence that he put his signature to mahazer Ex.P6 in the police station and not known the contents. He also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and he denied that police drew the mahazer on 07.11.2014 at House No.15,2nd floor, Old Bank Colony, Rushyashrunga Road, Bangalore and seized the mobile. 16. Pw6 Manjuanth complainant deposed in his evidence that on 01.11.2014 at 5-00 p.m., received the phone message from the public, it was attended by Idayith attender and on the same day at 6-00 p.m., Idayith told that he received from phone message from the public with respect of sexual assault. On the next day, he went to the shop of the accused along with Akshitha and introduced as BEO Office officials came to enquire about the victim, as she has not attended the classes. Accused called his wife to bring the victim girl. Victim girl and her mother came at 12-20 p.m., take away the victim girl in the Jeep and she disclosed the sexual assault by the accused since two years and also gave it in writing and reported the matter to the Director and Coordinator. Thereafter, lodged the complaint as per Ex.P7. 17. On perusal of the evidence of Pw1, Pw1 and Akshitha representing themselves that they are from BEO office had come to enquire about the victim girl, as why she has not attending the school regularly. Accused asked to bring the victim girl and victim girl was brought by her mother at 12-20 p.m., and on enquiry the victim girl narrated the incident and also in writing as per Ex.P2. 18. It is clear from the records that case has been registered based on the complaint lodged by the complainant. It is the case of the complainant that he was not in the office while Idayith attender received the phone call. Idayith attender of Child Line is not examined by the prosecution. Pw6 also admits that they have maintained the registers for having received the phone calls from the public. It is clear from the evidence of Pw1 that immediately after he came to know about the incident, he has not reported the incident to the Special Juvenile Unit or the Local police U/Sec.19(1)(a)(b) of POCSO Act 2012. Pw6 admits that he has not furnished the copy of the register maintained by them regarding phone call received in their office to the jurisdictional police. On perusal of the prosecution papers, Investigation Officer has not enquired Idayith attender of the Child Line who received the phone call from the public. On perusal of the evidence of Pw6, he lodged the complaint as per Ex.P7, after discussion with his superior officers and immediately he has not brought to the notice of the jurisdictional police with respect of the alleged incident. 19. The prosecution case is not supported by the evidence of Pw1 victim girl and she denied the incident in toto. She denied the sexual harassment by the accused and denied the contents of Ex.P1 and Ex.P2 is known to her. She denied that she has given complaint to the Child Line as per Ex.P2 and police drew mahazer on 07.11.2015. She also stated that Ex.P2 is not in her hand writing and she only signed and she does not know to read and write English and Kannada. The prosecution case is also not supported by the evidence of Pw2 Bhavani Devi mother of the victim girl and Pw3 Balaram relative of the complainant. They have denied the incident and also denied that they have stated before the police as per Ex.P3 to Ex.P5. 20. Ex.P1 mahazer dated 07.11.2014 alleged to have been drawn in the house of the victim girl is not supported by the victim girl and Pw4 Ravi Kumar deposed that he has signed the mahazer in the police station. Ex.P6 mahazer dated 07.11.2014 is also not proved by the prosecution. Pw5 Annappa who is a mahazer witness deposed in his evidence that he has not known the contents of Ex.P6 and he put his signature about 6 months back at Subramanyapura police station and not known its contents. Hence, Ex.P7 mahazer is also not proved by the prosecution satisfactorily. 21. In an offence under section 376 of Indian Penal Code the evidence of the prosecution plays a vital role. The evidence of the victim girl can be accepted without there being corroboration. However, if there are any inconsistency or discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, then the court has to look for corroboration to the evidence of the victim girl, but the prosecution case is not supported by the evidence of the victim girl herself. 22. The prosecution case is also not supported by the evidence of Pws. 1 to 3 and mahazer witness Pw4 and Pw5. The Investigation Officer is also not examined. The mobile phone which accused used to show obscene videos to the victim girl is also not seized by the Investigation Officer. 23. Thus the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt on the part of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. Hence, in view of all these reasons, I answer point No.1(a) to 1(d) in the negative. 24. Point No.2:- In view of the aforesaid reasons and findings on point Nos.1(a) to (d), accused is found not guilty for the above said offences, in the result, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER Acting under section 235(1) of Criminal Procedure Code, accused is acquitted for the offences punishable Under Section 354 and 376 of Indian Penal Code and section 5(L)(M) R/w.6 of POCSO Act 2012. Bail bonds and surety bonds shall stands cancelled. (Dictated to the Judgment writer, corrected and then pronounced in Open Court on this the 25th day of NOVEMBER, 2015.)

The 2nd respondent has produced the copy of the Aadhar Card. A joint compromise memo, dated 02.12.2022 has also been filed. The second respondent has stated that she affixed her signature without fear or coercion. The records would reveal that the date of birth of the victim girl is 03.06.2004 and she has attained majority. As it has been stated already, the marriage between the victim girl and the accused had taken place and they have constituted a family and become parents for a female child. In such circumstances, if the prosecution is allowed to continue, that will not serve any useful purpose and that will de-stabilize the family equilibrium of the petitioner and the victim. Even though the offences under POCSO Act are non-compoundable in nature, in the circumstances of the present case, I feel it is appropriate to take the cue from the principles laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Parbatbhai Aahir Vs. State of Gujarat reported in AIR 2017 SC 4843. In the said case, in Paragraph 15, it has held as under: 15.The Broad Principles which emerge from the precedents on the subject, may be summarised in the following propositions: (i) Section 482 Cr.P.C preserves the inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inherent in the High Court. (ii) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a first information report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the power of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the offence is non-compoundable. The petitioner who had married the victim girl, if subjected to trial that would affect the interest of the victim girl herself. In order to serve the ends of justice, I feel it is appropriate to quash the criminal proceedings against the petitioner by invoking the powers of this Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. In the result, this Criminal Original Petition stands allowed and as a sequel, the further proceedings in Crime No.76 of 2021 on the file of the 1strespondent, is quashed in terms of compromise. The terms of Joint Compromise Memo, dated 02.12.2022 shall form part of this Order.",
    "Question": "Given the highlighted marriage between the petitioner and the victim girl, analyze the implications for the legal proceedings under the POCSO Act in this case. How does the court justify its decision to quash the criminal proceedings despite the offences being classified as non-compoundable?",
    "A": "The court recognizes the marriage and family unit created as grounds to dismiss the legal proceedings.",
    "B": "The court believes the victim should be pursued for not preventing further underlying issues.",
    "C": "The court is bound to maintain all allegations even if a family unit is established.",
    "D": "The court dismisses the case as a means to obscure prior charges.",
    "Correct Answer": "The court recognizes the marriage and family unit created as grounds to dismiss the legal proceedings.",
    "Reasoning": "The passage clearly states that the court acknowledges the marriage and family dynamics of the petitioner, thus allowing for the quashing of the criminal proceedings as it would not serve justice and could harm the interests of the victim."

The petitioner is the sole accused in SC No.585 of 2019 pending before the First Additional Sessions Court (Special Court), Palakkad. The case against the petitioner originated on registration of Crime No.466 of 2018 at the Pudunagaram Police Station for offences under Section 376 (2) (n) of IPC and Sections 6 r/w 5 (j)(ii)(I) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The allegation which led to the registration of the Crime is that the petitioner and the victim had eloped on 18.05.2018, when the victim was a minor and that, after marrying the victim, the petitioner had subjected her to penetrating sexual assault and had thereby committed the offences. The aunt of the victim, who had filed the complaint leading to registration of the crime has filed an affidavit stating that the victim, whose parents were no more, had eloped with the petitioner and had married him. A legal marriage was conducted on 08.12.2019, after the victim became major and the marriage was registered on 25.02.2020. One girl child is born out of the relationship between the petitioner and the victim and that the petitioner and the victim are living as husband and wife. The victim has also filed an affidavit reiterating the above facts and further stating that she has no subsisting grievance against the petitioner. It is stated that continuance of the harmonious marital life of the petitioner and the victim require quashing of the criminal proceedings. I heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioner has no criminal antecedent and that the affidavit seeking quashing of the proceedings was submitted on her own volition. It is submitted that, though the sexual relationship of the petitioner with the victim was immediately prior to the victim becoming major, the fact that the petitioner had married the victim after she became a major and that both of them are leading a harmonious married life, can be taken into consideration. I take note of the fact that both the petitioner and the victim are rustic villagers and that after eloping from their parental homes, had married and lived as husband and wife. Immediately after the victim attaining 18 years, their marriage was registered and they are leading a harmonious marital life. Moreover, in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, there is no possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction. As such, continuance of the proceeding will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab, Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another, there is no impediment in granting the relief. In the aforementioned peculiar circumstances, I deem it appropriate to allow the Crl.M.C, even though the offences alleged are under Section 376 (2) (n) of IPC and Section 6 r/w 5 (j)(ii)(I) of the POCSO Act. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed; the proceedings in SC No.585 of 2019 pending before the First Additional Sessions Court (Special Court), Palakkad, is quashed.",

How might the court interpret the victim's expressed lack of grievance against the petitioner in shaping the legal outcome?",
    "A": "The court disregarded the affidavits and focused solely on the initial complaint.",

After recording statements from the witnesses and collecting the materials, the accused were arrested. A charge sheet was filed before the trial Court, listing 14 witnesses. Upon completion of the trial, the trial Court convicted the appellant (A1) under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. The second accused (A2) was convicted under Section 6 read with Section 17 @ 21 (1) of the POCSO Act. The learned counsel for the appellant contends that the trial Court's finding is contrary to both the law and the weight of the evidence. The learned counsel submits that the trial Court failed to properly consider the statement made by the victim, P.W.2, who categorically stated that she and the appellant had got married, and that a male child was born out of their relationship. According to P.W.2, she and the appellant were living together as husband and wife. P.W.2 further stated that their baby developed an infection in the umbilical cord, and the baby was taken to the Public Health Centre for treatment. From there, information was sent to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), which, according to the learned counsel, did not conduct a proper enquiry and rushed into action by lodging a complaint. The victim hails from a marginalized background and lives in poverty. It is the appellant's family that takes care of the victim, supports her, and provides aid in all aspects. In the result, the criminal appeal is allowed; the conviction and sentences imposed on the appellant/A1 by judgment dated 31.10.2023, in Spl.S.C.No.195 of 2022, by the learned Sessions Judge, Special Court for Exclusive Trial of Cases under the POCSO Act, Chennai, is set aside and he is acquitted from all the charges.",

    "Question": "In the case of Yallaling vs The State, how does the legal framework surrounding child abuse play a role in determining the appropriateness of the bail request considering the charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act?",
    "A": "The court must totally disregard the testimonies and just rely on the age of the accused for the bail decision.",

The case of the prosecution as is evident from Ex.P1 is that the prosecutrix had lodged a complaint on 31.10.2013 at 19.20 hours accusing her father-accused herein of sexual abusing her from the year 2012. Based on the complaint, the Appellant registered a case in Crime No.108/2013, for the offences punishable under Sections 376(2), 377, 342, 324, 504, 506 of IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012. The statement of the prosecutrix was recorded on 07.11.2013. She was subjected to medical examination on 31.10.2013, and it was provisionally mentioned that the prosecutrix was 'used to the act like that of sexual intercourse'. The prosecutrix alleged further incidents of rape. However, after a detailed inquiry, the trial court acquitted the accused due to lack of concrete evidence. The State has now challenged this acquittal in the present appeal.",
    "Question": "In this case, what legal remedies are available for the prosecutrix based on the information provided and the outcome of the previous trial? Considering that the court found the evidence insufficient to convict the accused, how can the legal system still protect the rights of the child victim in this specific scenario?",

    "D": "Victim compensation laws should be applied and a new trial initiated based on any additional evidence that may come to light.",
    "Correct Answer": "The legal system should ensure that the child victim receives counseling and support services despite the acquittal.",
    "Reasoning": "Regardless of the trial's outcome, it is essential to prioritize the well-being of the child victim. Counseling and support services are crucial to help her cope with the emotional and psychological effects of the abuse and the trial process."

The trial court has made an observation that with regard to awarding compensation is concerned, though the prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of the accused by producing consisting and corroborative evidence, but as per the medical evidence, it appears that she was sexually assaulted and she has suffered mental agony.

CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 29.12.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No.5644 OF 2020(E)\nORDER\nDated this the 29th day of December 2020\nThe petitioner is the accused in SC.No.698/2019 before the Additional District and Sessions (POCSO) Court, Ernakulam. The accused is alleged to have committed offences under Section 376(2) of Indian Penal Code read with Section 6 and 5J(ii) of the POCSO Act, 2012. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that petitioner and the 2nd respondent - the victim, were in love with each other and in their relationship, a child was even born. Photograph of the child along with the petitioner and the 2nd respondent is produced as Ann: A6. It is also pleaded that the crime No.342/2019 was registered on the basis of some misunderstanding and that, subsequent to the birth of the child, petitioner as well as the 2nd respondent have married each other. True copy of the marriage certificate issued by the marriage officer, Njarackal is produced as Ann: A4 and the birth certificate of the child is produced as Ann: A5. The prosecution alleges that on 26.1.2019, at 11.00 a.m, the petitioner committed rape on the victim and the victim became pregnant. The crime was registered on the basis of a complaint by the victim. According to the petitioner, the victim and the petitioner were involved in a romantic relationship and have even married. The complaint was filed on a total misunderstanding and no proper investigation was also carried out. It is contended that continuance of the proceedings is a sheer abuse of the process of Court and no purpose will be served other than waste of judicial time. Petitioner is only aged 25 years and taking into consideration the gravity of the offences alleged as well as the subsequent developments, especially the marriage between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent and the settlement arrived at there is no purpose in continuing the case. The settlement is reflected through Ann: A3 affidavit, wherein the victim as well as her parents have sworn to an affidavit, stating that they have no complaints or allegations against the petitioner and they have come into to good terms with each other and also that no purpose would be served in continuing the criminal proceedings. The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, submits that the Police have taken the statement of the victim and have verified the veracity of the affidavit produced before this Court as Ann: A3. According to the learned prosecutor, the affidavit is genuine and can be acted upon. In view of the above circumstances, continuance of the proceedings in SC No.698/2019 before the Sessions Court, Ernakulam will only be an abuse of the process of Court. Since the matter has been settled by the parties and the petitioner has admittedly married the alleged victim, no evidence will be forthcoming to support the prosecution case. Continuance of the prosecution is therefore an abuse of process of Court and serves no purpose. In the result, the Crl.MC is allowed. Proceedings in SC.No.698/2019 on the files of the Additional District and Sessions (POCSO) Court, Ernakulam initiated as per Annexure A2 is quashed.\n\nSd/\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE",
