      "(d) The basic components of presumption of innocence are:\n",
      "(i) Age of innocence\n",
      "Age of innocence is the age below which a juvenile or child or a juvenile in conflict with law\n",

      "of best interest of the juvenile or the juvenile in conflict with law or child shall be the primary\n",
      "consideration.\n",
      "(b) The principle of best interest of the juvenile or juvenile in conflict with law or child shall\n",

The Beijing Rule 4(1) clearly lays down that\\n“the beginning of the age of criminal responsibility shall not be fixed at too low an age level\\nbearing in mind the facts of mental and intellectual maturity”. In consonance with this principle,\\nthe mental and intellectual maturity of juvenile or child or a juvenile in conflict with law below\\neighteen years is considered insufficient through out the world.\\n4\\n\\n--- juvenile-justice-care-and-protection-of-chidlren-rules-2007.pdf ---\\n(ii) Procedural protection of innocence\\nAll procedural safeguards that are guaranteed by the Constitution and other statutes to the adults\\nand that go in to strengthen the juvenile’s or child’s right to presumption of innocence shall be\\nguaranteed to juveniles or the children or juveniles in conflict with law.\\n(iii) Provisions of Legal aid and Guardian Ad Litem\\nJuveniles in conflict with law have a right to be informed about the accusations against them and\\na right to be legally represented.

Respect of dignity includes not being humiliated, personal identity,\\nboundaries and space being respected, not being labeled and stigmatized, being offered\\ninformation and choices and not being blamed for their acts.\\n(b) The juvenile’s or child’s right to dignity and worth has to be respected and protected\\nthroughout the entire process of dealing with the child from the first contact with law\\nenforcement agencies to the implementation of all measures for dealing with the child.\\nIII. Principle of Right to be heard:\\nEvery child’s right to express his views freely in all matters affecting his interest shall be fully\\nrespected through every stage in the process of juvenile justice.

Principle of family responsibility:\\n(a) The primary responsibility of bringing up children, providing care, support and protection\\nshall be with the biological parents. However, in exceptional situations, this responsibility may\\nbe bestowed on willing adoptive or foster parents.\\n(b) All decision making for the child should involve the family of origin unless it is not in the\\nbest interest of the child to do so.\\n(c) The family - biological, adoptive or foster (in that order), must be held responsible and\\nprovide necessary care, support and protection to the juvenile or child under their care and\\ncustody under the Act, unless the best interest measures or mandates dictate otherwise.\\nVI. Principle of Safety (no harm, no abuse, no neglect, no exploitation and no\\nmaltreatment):\\n(a) At all stages, from the initial contact till such time he remains in contact with the care and\\nprotection system, and thereafter, the juvenile or child or juvenile in conflict with law shall not\\nbe subjected to any harm, abuse, neglect, maltreatment, corporal punishment or solitary or\\notherwise any confinement in jails and extreme care shall be taken to avoid any harm to the\\nsensitivity of the juvenile or the child.\\n(b) The state has a greater responsibility for ensuring safety of every child in its care and\\nprotection, without resorting to restrictive measures and processes in the name of care and\\nprotection.\\nVII.

Principle of non-waiver of rights:\\n(a) No waiver of rights of the child or juvenile in conflict with law, whether by himself or the\\ncompetent authority or anyone acting or claiming to act on behalf of the juvenile or child, is\\neither permissible or valid.\\n(b) Non-exercise of a fundamental right does not amount to waiver.\\nX. Principle of equality and non-discrimination:\\n(a) There shall be no discrimination against a child or juvenile in conflict with law on the\\nbasis of age, sex, place of birth, disability, health, status, race, ethnicity, religion, caste, cultural\\npractices, work, activity or behaviour of the juvenile or child or that of his parents or guardians,\\nor the civil and political status of the juvenile or child.\\n(b) Equality of access, equality of opportunity, equality in treatment under the Act shall be\\nguaranteed to every child or juvenile in conflict with law.\\nXI.

Principle of repatriation and restoration:\\n(a) Every juvenile or child or juvenile in conflict with law has the right to be re-united with\\nhis family and restored back to the same socio-economic and cultural status that such juvenile or\\nchild enjoyed before coming within the purview of the Act or becoming vulnerable to any form\\nof neglect, abuse or exploitation.\\n7\\n\\n--- juvenile-justice-care-and-protection-of-chidlren-rules-2007.pdf ---\\n(b) Any juvenile or child, who has lost contact with his family, shall be eligible for\\nprotection under the Act and shall be repatriated and restored, at the earliest, to his family, unless\\nsuch repatriation and restoration is likely to be against the best interest of the juvenile or the\\nchild.\\nXIV.
